i dont want to know how to say that though i want to know useful things like where the good stores are how much does champagne cost stuff like chat i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone
right see youre ready for the quiz
cesc ma tete this is my head
let me see what i can do
gosh if only we could find kat a boyfriend
thats a shame
unsolved mystery she used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
why
seems like she could get a date easy enough
the thing is cameron im at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser my sister i cant date until she does
cameron
no no its my fault we didnt have a proper introduction
forget it
youre asking me out thats so cute whats your name again
okay then how bout we try out some french cuisine saturday night
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part please
well i thought wed start with pronunciation if thats okay with you

you know the deal i can t go if kat doesnt go
listen i want to talk to you about the prom
youre concentrating awfully hard considering its gym class
hi joey
hey sweet cheeks
my agent says ive got a good shot at being the prada guy next year

queen harry
so yeah ive got the sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig thats gonna be huge and then im up for an ad for queen harry next week
hopefully
exactly so you going to bogey lowenbraus thing on saturday
expensive
its more
i have a date daddy and he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
im missing something
fine i see that im a prisoner in my own house im not a daughter im a possession
youre not going unless your sister goes end of story
hes not a hot rod whatever that is
its that hot rod joey right that s who you want me to bend my rules for
no but
the prom kat has a date
daddy i want to discuss the prom with you its tomorrow night
because shell scare them away
why
promise me you wont talk to any boys unless your sister is present
just for a minute
daddy no
wear the belly before you go
its just a party daddy
oh god its starting
if kats not going youre not going
daddy people expect me to be there
its just a party daddy but i knew youd forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there isnt going
otherwise known as an orgy
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
and wherere you going
daddy i
exactly my point
but she doesnt want to date
but its not fair shes a mutant daddy
then neither will you and ill get to sleep at night
what if she never starts dating
no youre not dating until your sister starts dating end of discussion
now dont get upset daddy but theres this boy and i think he might ask
just sent em through
padua girls one tall decent body the other one kinda short and undersexed
never
fan of a fan you see a couple of minors come in
didnt have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan arent they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you
always a pleasure brucie
best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile
you humiliated the woman sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score
no i m not
buttholus extremus but hey youre making progress
the hell is that what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while youre talking to her
extremely unfortunate maneuver
hell ive just been going over the whole thing in my head and
you told me that part already
its her favorite band
assail your ears for one night
okay i wasnt sure
hes pretty
dead at fortyone
her favorite uncle
its a lung cancer issue
number one she hates smokers
are you kidding hell piss himself with joy hes the ultimate kiss ass
will bogey get bent
in that case well need to make it a schoolwide blow out
this is it a golden opportunity patrick can ask katarina to the party
like we had a choice besides when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power we let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo bianca
you got him involved
hey ive gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street
i thought you hated those people
you know if you do go out with bianca youd be set youd outrank everyone strictly alist with me by your side
thats what i just said
did she actually say shed go out with you
forget his reputation do you think weve got a plan or not
im serious man hes whacked he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers
they always let felons sit in on honors biology
no kidding hes a criminal i heard he lit a state trooper on fire he just got out of alcatraz
he seems like he thrives on danger
what makes you think hell do it
you wanna go out with him
what about him
unlikely but even so she still cant go out with you so whats the point
i teach her french get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me
the mewling rampalian wretch herself
thats her biancas sister
yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew
you could consecrate with her my friend
you mean id get a chance to talk to her
guess who just signed up for a tutor
sure do my moms from canada
you know french
joey dorsey permashitgrin i wish i could say hes a moron but hes number twelve in the class and a model mostly regional stuff but hes rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
he always have that shiteating grin
because theyre bred to their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them their gene pool is rarely diluted
why do girls like that always like guys like that
i could start with your haircut but it doesnt matter shes not allowed to date until her older sister does and thats an impossibility
why not
bianca stratford sophomore dont even think about it
who is she
you burn you pine you perish
that girl i
yeah but these guys have never seen a horse they just jack off to clint eastwood
that im used to
couple thousand most of them evil
how many people go here
get out
thirtytwo
how many people were in your old school
yeah a couple were outnumbered by the cows though
i was kidding people actually live there
north actually howd you
so which dakota you from
cmon im supposed to give you the tour
so they tell me
you the new guy
you get the girl
whats the worst
where
she kissed me
you makin any headway
she just needs time to cool off ill give it a day
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns thats a direct quote
i don t know i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
whatd you do to her
then go get her
sure
cameron do you like the girl
shes partial to joey not me
what re you talking about
its off the whole thing
cameron im a little busy
dont make me do it man
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night
so what does that give me im supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who cant play their instruments
okay likes thai food feminist prose and angry stinky girl music of the indierock persuasion
ive retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think youll find helpful
whatve you got for me
yeah well see
and he means that strictly in a non prisonmovie type of way
and why would i do that
leave my sister alone
your sister here
away
where ya goin
not at all
hey do you mind
theyre running the rest of me next month
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow tough break
the vintage look is over kat havent you been reading your sassy
enough with the barbie n ken shit i know
i dont know dorsey the limothe flowers another hundred for the tux
get her to act like a human
do what
howd you do it
a deals a deal
its about time
forget her sister then
forget it
a hundred bucks a date
what
i just upped my price
i got her under control she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
watching the bitch trash my car doesnt count as a date
im on it
when i shell out fifty i expect results
fifty and youve got your man
take it or leave it this isnt a negotiation
fine thirty
i cant take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
how much
i cant date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend and thats the catch she doesnt want a boyfriend
youre gonna pay me to take out some girl
you got it verona i pick up the tab you do the honors
but youd go out with her if you had the cake
you need money to take a girl out
you just said
sure sparky ill get right on it
yeah whatever i want you to go out with her
two legs nice rack
what do you think
yeah
hey its all for the higher good right
you better not fuck this up im heavily invested
what we took bathes together when we were kids
you and verona
uh yeah were old friend
i hear youre helpin verona
so what you need to do is recruit a guy wholl go out with her someone whos up for the job
does this conversation have a purpose
but she cant go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her right
were not
well actually i thought id run an idea by you you know just to see if youre interested
we dont chat
nope just came by to chat
are you lost
hey
don t you even dare
oh bianca can you get me my freshman yearbook
because i like to torture you
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
yeah but then i fucked up i fell for her
is that right
besides i had some extra cash some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
i thought you could use it when you start your band
a fender strat you bought this
i didnt care about the money
really what was it like a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
it wasnt like that
you were paid to take me out by the one person i truly hate i knew it was a setup
wait i
it gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook
that s completely adorable
thats where i was last year shed never lived alone my grandfather died i stayed with her i wasnt in jail i dont know marilyn manson and ive never slept with a spice girl i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune end of story
what
my grandmothers
look im sorry that i questioned your motives i was wrong
oh huh
its just something i had you know
its scurvys his date got convicted whered you get the dress
howd you get a tux at the last minute
nothing theres nothing in it for me just the pleasure of your company
answer the question patrick
you need therapy has anyone ever told you that
you tell me
so i have to have a motive to be with you
create a little drama start a new rumor what
because i dont want to its a stupid tradition
why not
no i wont go with you
no what
no
you know what i mean
is that a request or a command
go to the prom with me
youre amazingly selfassured has anyone ever told you that
no one else knows
what
youre sweet and sexy and completely hot for me
no something real something no one else knows
i hate peas
tell me something true
i know the porn careers a lie
hearsay
the duck
fallacy
state trooper
for
you up for it
you never disappointed me
how
then you screwed up
something like that
so if you disappoint them from the start youre covered
i dont like to do what people expect then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change
yes
acting the way we do
so whats your excuse
yeah well dont let it get out
a soft side who knew
i dazzled him with my wit
so howd you get chapin to look the other way
good call
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect and piss you off
the partridge family
maybe
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down
forget it im stayin
put your right foot there
try lookin at it from this angle
cmon its not that bad
i guess i never told you im afraid of heights
look up sunshine
he left i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
other than my upchuck reflex nothing
so what did i have an effect on
dont for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
unwelcome i guess someone still has her panties in a twist
unwelcome
wholesome

i hate him
dorsey
who
whyd you let him get to you
just let me sit down
see that who needs affection when ive got blind hatred
like you could find one
because then id have to start taking out girls who like me
why
sure i do
you dont care if i die
i told you
why re you doing this
leave it to you to use big words when youre shitfaced
this is so patronizing
what if you have a concussion my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable not that i could tell the difference

at your service
cornilius
appipulai leeloo minai
i know
you are a monster zorg
let me reassure you fatheri will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last years
destroying a glass is one thingkilling people with the weapons you produce is quite another
father by creating a little destruction i am in fact encouraging life so in reality you and i are in the same business
they are robots
look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden notice how each one is useful what a lovely ballet so full of form and color so full oflife
follow me life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction look at this empty glass
no thank you
would you like a drink
ah father you are so wrong let me explain
im a priest im here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it
why whats wrong with me
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you
personally they are of no interest to me id rather sell weaponsbut i have a customer so tell me
why on earth do the stones interest you
im glad you got your memory back father because youre going to need it where are the stones
i remember you nowthe so called art dealer
zorg jeanbaptiste emmanuel zorg nice to see you again
im fucked
were saved
thats what im saying
and you dont know how they open is that what you are saying
yes of course but the stones are shut they have to be open for it to work
theres no light you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
theoretically yes the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there but i dont have the reference book ive never seen the stones work
dont tell me you dont know how all this works
uh have you tried the divas suite
when is she not in trouble
leeloos in trouble
yeah i know to save the world but right now all i want to do is save leeloo
youre probably very angry with me and i quite understand but i want you to know im fighting for a noble cause
trying to save your ass so you can save the world
what are you doing
father i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends so thanks for the offer but no thanks
of course
good luck
we have to save the world
what kind of mission
were not going on vacationwere on a mission
is that the usual way priests go on vacation
im sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston
thats what i thought
it means never without my permission
excuse me just one thing she said something to me a while ago and i dont really get it akta gamat
i know i was there when she arrived
shes fine reallydont you worry just needs some restshes had a very long trip
i might call to check up on her you know to see if shes better
yes thats fine thank you very much a thousand times over
dallas korben dallas
thank you so much for your help mr
shes an exception
they all like this in your family father
uh yes were cousinsdistant cousins
so you do know her
theres not a moment to lose wake her up but be gentle about it this woman is mankinds most precious possession she is perfect
you noticed
hes a she
the girl
i brought the girl remember
who are you
she dropped in on me holding this
thats me but i dont know who she is where did you find her
shes not my bride shes my fare shes looking for this vito cornelius according to the phone guide he lives here
weddings are one floor down congratulations
excuse me im looking for a priest
this is government business now you ought to go home and get some rest father
what are we going to do
thank you mr president
did you see thatthingswallow our battleship like a gum drop you cant even tell me what it is i ask you for options you give me bullshit give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards
white turns to black light to dark life to death for all eternity
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here
yesthank god
is there anything that can stop it
and then it will be too late the goal of evil is to wipe out life all forms of life for all eternitylife upsets it
and then
we have fortyeight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
thats exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some billion of our fellow citizens general you may fire when ready
time is of no importance mr president only life is important
your theory is interesting father but i dont think we have time to go into it right now
one more reason to shoot first eh
imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are because it is evil total evil
later david later theres not a minute to lose
youre all safe thanks be to god
its all my fault im the servant its my mission here
on the plane with mr dallas the real one
wheres leeloo
good work my son now all we need is a way to get there
i got it everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel
perfect
they really made her
i didnt know your size
there was this guy with a limp who came a month agosaid he was an art dealer asking all these questions about the sacred stonesat the time i didnt think anything of it what was his name im so bad with names
yes of course
uh father i know shes been through a lot but the sacred stoneswe dont have much time
learning our history the last years that she missed shes been out of circulation a while you know
whats she doing
absolutely sure theres the triple suns on her gloves
father you sure shes the supreme being
the supreme being the fifth element is here in our parish its a miracle
father will you please explain whats going on
i cant wear these clothes this calls for dignity i have to dress the part
what is
its a miracle
they are with me
im sorry but the stones
i would like to have died in peace
listen the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her i never saw her again
i dont have time i need to know
i i dont know we hardly know each other it takes time
do you love her
ill help her i promise but i think you should tell me where the stones are
she was taught to love the life of others but not her own you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live
so cornelius was telling the truth
yes and more than that you must give her the stones shes the only one who knows how to use them
leeloo is shes
the fifth element the supreme being your wife

youre seeing bugs where they dont exist striker
thats right striker and were getting married when we return
are you on the mercury mission
well we laughed we laughed all the time
no its hard to laugh when your fathers dying
i just wish it was that simple we really were in love you know how it is when you laugh all the time
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when theres change in the two people who share that love
sure but thats only when the love itself goes unchanged
not if the people change together in relation to that love
people change in relation to each other love changes on its own
loves the same as it always was its people who change
we were in love but im not sure i know what love is anymore
no i mean your relationship
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me

george zipp said that
im doing everything i can and stop calling me shirley
surely there must be something you can do
i wont deceive you mister striker were running out of time
yes everything theyve got how are the passengers doing
will the hospital equipment be at the airport
chicago the passengers are beginning to panic when do we start down
safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment
lets see those are the flaps thats the thrust this must turn on the landing lights
elaine i havent time to put this gently so ill be very direct everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation mister striker is the only hope weve got
well i flew singleengine fighters in the air force but this plane has four engines its an entirely different kind of flyinguallu utogetheru
i uamu serious and dont call me shirley what flying experience have you had
surely you cant be serious
can you fly this airplane and land it
both pilots
uhhuh
see them elaine
the gear is down
tell them the gear is down and were ready to land
i wanted you to know now im very proud

ted
i dont care i just dont have what it takes theyd be better off with someone whod never flown before

oil pressure i forgot to check the oil pressure when kramer hears about this the shits gonna hit the fan

sluggish like a wet sponge
sluggish like a wet sponge
and a little ice

rain
thats what ive been trying to tell these people
ted what are you doing you cant fly this plane
a lot of people made plans before the war like george zipp
ted i dont want to stay here its time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war
i think theyre getting the hang of it when we reenlist ill teach them baseball
thats lieutennt hurwitz severe shell shock he thinks hes ethel merman
whats his problem
be patient ted no one expects you to get over this immediately
i wish i could say the same for george zipp
seven lieutenant zipp died this morning ted doctor sandler says youll be out in a week isnt that wonderful
is it because of my mistake six men didnt return from that raid
its a big building where the generals meet but thats not important right now theyve cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid isnt that good news
headquarters what is it
you got a telegram from headquarters today
but it wont be not as long as you insist on living in the past
thats the way ive always wanted it to be elaine
mostly i rememberthe nights when we were together i remember how you used to hold meand how i used to sit on your face and wriggleand then afterwards how wed watch until the sun came up when it did it was almost likelike each new day was createdonly for us
i remember everything all i have are memories
elaine just hear me out i know things havent been right for a long time but it will be differentlike it was in the beginning remember

ted what are you doing here
its too late ted when i get back to chicago im going to start my life all over again im sorry

its the truth whats hurt you the most is your record since the war different cities different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility
you expect me to believe that
your uwaru urecordu youre the only one keeping that alive for everyone else its ancient history
you know i havent been able to get near an airplane since the war and even if i could they wouldnt hire me because of my war record
then why dont you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing
elaine not yet i promise you i really can change
i wont be back ive requested the atlanta run

i have been patient and ive tried to help but you wouldnt even let me do that
i know things havent been right for a long time but itll be different if youll just be patient i can work things out

youve left my wife a widow and my children fatherless and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolfs bloodline is severed and the curse lifted
mr bringsly im sorry i have absolutely no idea what to say to you
this isnt mr goodmans idea he is your good friend whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities

dr hirsch id rather not be by myself
believe me the hound of the baskervilles was an invention of sir arthur conan doyles and if youd read the bloody book youd find that holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud a fake
you really think im crazy dont you
david please the police are satisfied im certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england wed have seen it on the telly
then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me you yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that
i really dont know
did you talk to the police in east proctor did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb
no in fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
did you see jack
youd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of
look dr hirsch i know ive been traumatized but jack was torn apart i saw him a man cant do that to someone with his bare hands
yes
ive told you it wasnt a man it was an animal a big wolf or something a rabid dog
did you get a good look at the man who attacked you
sure as a kid but never so real never so bizarre
youve never had bad dreams before
doctor my memory is fine its my sanity im beginning to worry about
in time im sure it will all come back to you
how could there have been witnesses it was so dark we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere i dont understand what theyre talking about
so they said
there were witnesses
now weve just given you a pretty strong sedative so try to get some rest now miss price will see to your needs rest now
lunatic
youve suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while youll have some dueling scars to boast of that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow they say a mad man has the strength of ten
two weeks
youve been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
how long have i been here

youre absolutely right i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant im just weak sister im so weak
there can be no excuse for tardiness
i know sister but i have a very good excuse
youre late again rick
oh that will be sent after him i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers you say and at noon after parade shall be at the inn you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair and will wait for me at the chevaliers rooms until my arrival we must force that box you are a clumsy hound or you would have got the key long ago
and his baggage
you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on
not yet but i believe he intends to
has he sent the challenge yet
i am not sure the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
what are the chevaliers intentions
i had thought you more expert you must find out if the chevalier cheats he sees the english and austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole if you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself we look at them there but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger he sleeps with the keys of his dispatchbox with a string around his neck twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys
only a very little as soldiers do
you are a hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins he gambles a great deal and wins do you know the cards well
there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast and wears the red riband and star of the popes order of the spur he is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet
what is the service sir
your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of guineas
the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police herr galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemens promotion
how do you do sir
good morning private james please come in i should like you to meet my uncle herr minister of police galgenstein
neither
its a lie youre a deserter youre an impostor sir your lies and folly have confirmed this to me you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you dont know will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up
sir im a british officer
i have acted as i think fit
upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly
it was my joke i was tired and did not care to go farther theres not prettier woman here than that if she wont suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile
wheres the beauty you promised me
the people are great farmers as well as innkeepers
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
ah you sly rogue i see that will influence you
do you want to see the loveliest woman in europe
this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach
this is a very good inn shall we stop for dinner
oh yes of course ambassador ogrady
ogrady
what is your uncles name
my companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about england which i answered as best i might but this best i am bound to say was bad enough i knew nothing about england and i invented a thousand stories which i told him described the king and the ministers to him said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him
he has paid off your uncles mortgage he gave dorothy a coach andsix that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncles family faith the business was well done your cousins michael and harry never let him out of their sight though he was for deserting to england until the marriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to dublin are you in want of cash my boy you may draw upon me for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and while they last you shall never want
the coward
no the very same one my boy he recovered from his wound the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him it was only made of tow do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred ayear out of the family the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you but hit him you certainly did roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to we told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made
mrs john best was there another mr john best
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband she is now mrs john best
good heavens whatever has she died of grief
theres only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
is miss dugan well
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown
we must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to brown bess
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office
i had news of you in dublin faith youve begun early like your fathers son but i think you could not do better than as you have done but why did you not write home to your poor mother she has sent halfadozen letters to you in dublin
grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which i wanted of my family
a man of honor dies but never apologizes ill see the captain hanged before i apologize
look here roderick my boy this is silly business the girl will marry best mark my words and as sure as she does youll forget her you are but a boy best is willing to consider you as such dublins a fine place and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month here are twenty guineas at your service make best an apology and be off
it must have been some other gate
not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
but swords are today impossible captain best is is lame he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
ill match any man with the sword
oh its with pistols we fight you are no match for best with the sword
i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bullys body
i am harry james son and will act as becomes my name and quality
and now you risk the same fate if you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
it was with this sword that my late father harry james god rest his soul met sir huddelstone fuddelstone the hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck he was quite in the wrong having insulted lady fuddelstone when in liquor at the brentford assembly but like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
thats a very handsome sword you have there
your cousins go out with him
my mare is saddled and ready whos the captains second
the meeting is arranged captain best is waiting for you now
have you taken my message to him
in faith i believe you are not for a lad i never saw more game in my life give me a kiss my dear boy youre after my own soul as long as jack grogan lives you shall never want a friend or a second
hell give the better mark i am not afraid of him
well if it must be it must for a young fellow you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw no officer bearing his majestys commission can receive a glass of wine on his nose without resenting it fight you must and best is a huge strong fellow
mark this come what will of it i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan ill follow him if its into the church and meet him there ill have his blood or he shall have mine will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting
and this is the return you make for his kindness didnt he harbor you in his house when your father died and hasnt he given you and your mother rentfree your fine house of jamesville yonder
and so i am
a pretty days work of it you have made master roderick knowing your uncle to be distressed for money and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred ayear into the family best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so he takes a girl without a penny a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past and missing them all and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father
faith i think you are a lad thats likely to keep your word
dorothy might love me or not as she likes but best will have to fight me before he marries her
the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me do you mind that
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family
i have said all there is to be said i am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish good night
your grace if i am so tame as to take this then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation
chevalier if you will have your money now you must fight for it if you will be patient maybe i will pay you something another time
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which i have honorably won
i dont know
i deny your graces accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
chevalier though i cannot say how i believe you have cheated me
the gentleman has nothing contraband
i have no luggage
as you please
all europe shall hear of this
your honor must lower his voice
ten thousand but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
it is shameful infamous i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassadors house
you are going to drive to the frontier
good gracious what is this
i will let down the steps for your honor
where is my rascal lazlo
perfectly certain because i shall make him tremble
certain
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him
to risk ones life against such people is an imposition
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel that should be work for a hangman
sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months if your highness bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet you
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask
then ordering fresh horses the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital i need not tell you that i was the chevalier
gentlemen i wish you a good day will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to three kings at dresden
but how sir
make your mind easy you shall not be left behind i warrant you do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in berlin the dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
but if they send you away then what is to become of me
i have faced that problem before
i believe they will deport you
have no fear it will come out well for me
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
we will practice in the mornings my boy and ill put you up to a thing or two worth knowing
i can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
the cards are now my only livelihood sometimes i am in luck and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see its property look you and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me when the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste do you understand the cards
id give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place
and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood
only the agency of servants
who else can give me information about you
no one sir before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
for whom else have you worked
herr seebach was a very kind employer
you come highly recommended by herr seebach
yes sir

i dont want anyone to die
maybe i want to die dont you want me to die
nobodys that unhappy

shes alive she is not dead
shes alive
i dont know why i said it im sorry
what
i dont know why i said that shes not dead at all
im sorry
shes dead
did she leave you come on its nothing to be ashamed of who did she leave you for your best friend her boss a woman did she leave you for a woman john
its none of your business she didnt have small eyes
the thin the girl with small eyes the one in your cupboard
what
what happened between you and the blonde
not really maybe a little
are you scared
no
have you had any before
no
do you know if its a boy or a girl
well what have you got
i dont have nothing
im pretty naive look at you you have to do all this and what have you got to show for it nothing
you are pretty naive if you think it is
thank christ for that
the rest of the world john its not all like st albans
yeah hes a smashing bloke
fifteen you dont know him he was very kind and strong
then okay so how old were you when you met him
i wasnt saying anything
please theres no oh
what i i wasnt saying
you dont have to say anything
you know in russia theres no work for women its a different world
get out
you are throwing me out
get out
excuse me
you dont understand you either
you dont understand me
so what did you want i think we understand each other no
it wasnt what i wanted
you didnt mind too much
i got what i paid for
you
what
oh i think you will recover okay i think you got what you paid for
i think its my safest bet dont you
so now you hate all women
well its just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman or alone for that matter makes me want to die
why
i dont like sex i dont think ill be having sex ever again
theres nothing wrong in liking sex john
some what does that mean
sometimes neither
sometimes which
sometimes
so what do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine youre with him or what
listen i didnt go rooting around in your private stuff
whereas wet n wild is an emotional journey tied and tethered its pretty moving huh like anna karenina
so what then you just detach sex from everything
whats a moral orgasm john tell me how it feels exactly
and that would be morals that would be ones own moral sense of decency
and who says what is wrong
and its wrong
and what are you saying
okay lets okay okay you have had sex with people you dont like havent you for money to make money
i dont hate you
so whats it like having to fuck men you hate
well pretend it never happened
okay we wont talk about it
no
you dont want to talk about it
shut up im not listening
why not
i dont want to talk about it
no but you tend to tie them up
yeah i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too
he left me my passport and ticket its pretty clear he wants to see me again
excuse me
he will come back
not the kids type then is he not that broody you must be pretty miffed
but you know so what
of course of course of course he does of course thank you thanks
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
oh jesus
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
so uh
fine absolutely must be disappointing though must come as a hell of a shock
its none of your business
fine
i dont want to talk about him
so uh alexei which i know isnt his name
i said i dont have any
what
i dont have any money
give me some money
yes
shut up have you got your passport
what
have you got your passport
you dont have to do this i can look after myself
no youre not how nice one how dumb do you think i am
im going i am im going to be sick
what no youre not
im going to be sick wheres the
what
wheres the restroom
well nadia it its all the same to you id like to give it a bash
you cant hurt me more than im hurt already
in every sense if at all possible
so youre just going to be vindictive
i do i want to very badly
i know you just want to punish me
in the world
no i dont
you must think im the biggest pillock in the world
well as it turns out i did
why else would you send off for me if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
they dont blame you when a bank employee does this they understand you get your life back anyway i bet you hated that bank
im going to drink my coffee then were going to the police station where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison
so what are you going to do
thats a relief its nice to know im a regular guy
it makes it faster if i dont speak to the men they fall faster its pretty obvious why
i dont want to know
its makes it easier okay
unless unless this is part of the routine you get tied up stick around distract me they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee
i think that about covers it i think i have grasped the part about you being dumped though thats got to hurt i imagine thats got to smart a bit i mean strictly in my observers capacity it seemed you two were getting on pretty fucking famously
you dont understand anything
oh i dont know in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals this took a lot of understanding and sympathy to try to work out solutions to their problems but you see im not in that line of work anymore nowadays im a bank robber
they go
of course they go yes yes
they go
whats wrong
they go john they go
yes i know
frenzy

what can i offer you eve
some time
well please excuse us wewe havent entertained a guest inum
to keep whats up there from getting down here its not the radiation im worried about
well thatsconsiderably shorter than before i was wondering calvin why set the locks at all i mean the radiation is gone and
i thought ten years
how long will you set it for this time
amen
and lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son adam amen
yes dear i know
hes smart
do as i say
and the ocean a mountain range
and we will
i want him to at least see the sky
well i am the head of this household
no calvin were not going to make do not me not adam were going up no matter what we deserve it even if its terrible
well make do im of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then
for how long weve just about run out of everything
excuse me
yes
we do
we stay down here
oh my ohmy oh my oh my so what do we do now
theyve done a lot of rebuilding but society at least as we knew it has utterly collapsed people throw up in the streets others point guns theres something terribly wrong with the automobiles andand ii cant tell you the rest i just cant
i dont believe it
yes
no
others aremultisexual it seemsthey can be both masculine and femininesimultaneously
its not a pretty sight some eat out of garbage cans others arecover your ears son and hum i mean that literally and i mean right now
mutants
im going to give it to you straight theres no point in beating around the bush there were survivors apparently the fallout has createda subspecies of mutants
yes thats right
its an archaic colloquialism roughly meaninggood
yes yes it is
just open the door
should we say a little prayer first
i know exactly what you mean hey honey
oh yes it just fascinates me how all these things work
in the generator room again
sure
would you excuse me
you know when we do go upim going to miss this old place how bout you hon
yes
if we still have one
yeah lets dig in
lets eat our cake
well well be going up in two years well know then im very hopeful
calvin webber what a thing to say
one who doesnt glow in the dark
well we did in my family
oh thats just a bunch of baloney we never believed that in my family
if he tells it wont come true
what did you wish for adam
and i made these
no kidding who else would have done it
you bet
get the presents and do the lights
coming
calvin
hi
hi honey
i believe there will be other survivors in fact im guessing theres life on the surface even now its not life worth living perhaps but believe me somethings moving around up there and i dont just mean the cockroaches
oh calvin im not sure we should be making promises that perhaps cant be kept
yes you certainly will and youll find a nice girl and rebuild america just the way it used to be
nonsense people have no idea what the human mind is capable of look at us
yes hes very bright dear much like his father but you know calvin maybe hes a littleyoung for school
not bad for a three and a half year old id like to see the public school system match that i dont care how terrific it is
what
watch this
yes well yes
very nice unless it caved in too
no reason well its pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off so you know when the time is up well have to return to the surface using you know this back entrance which is very nice because it has the service elevator
why
oh i was just examining this rear hatchway
we looked all over for you what are you doing back here
right here
calvin
what whatever you want helen
if iyou know
yes
and i was wonderingifif i could have a
no i think its just right
what shall we call him
ive noticed
no calvin babies cry
is there a problem
honey
uh oh now its time
what
oh no
i told you ive got everything
you have tranquilizers
would you like a tranquilizer
no no calvin this is different believe me
how could you this is just like home
maybe ive just got the creeps
really
no calvin youre favorite
hot dr pepper your favorite
im not hungry
burnt to a crisp ive given you the most welldone cut
all our friends
we have to be strong sweetheart if not for ourselves for the child
no
hi honey feeling better
to go up
to go up
its safe
then after that its safe
thirty five years
to keep us from trying to leave after an atomic blast theres a radiation halflife that lasts thirty five years
the locks
the locks
whats that noise
to you maybe
home sweet home
as long as weve got that straight
yes dear
now you listen to me calvin webber when this baby comes youre going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers
ive read up on it ill deliver the baby myself if i have to
but what if i go into labor that could happen any time
rather safe than sorry thats my motto
days
i dont know for this thing to blow over it could take days
how long will we have to stay down here
yeah yeah okay give me the roast and watch your step ill come back for the radio
oh much worse but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip you remember that
worse than your kraft holiday dip
cheese is particularly troublesome
i just hope those plates arent radioactive by tomorrow morning
calvin i wish you would have at least let me do the dishes its not going to be that easy getting all that dried on food off my nice plates
yes
you hear that
i never know anymore
no they all do
did you rig it to do that youre so clever
it shuts off automatically
time oh no calvin its not time yet i still have
its time
well do this again maybe next week heres your hat could i wrap something up for you did you have a coat
im sorry everyone but given this extraordinary turn of events i think its prudent that we cut the evening short im sure this cuban thing will resolve itself but in the meantimeid suggest taking a prayerful watchandwait stance
you bet hon
well put it down and come in
sorry honey i just got to fooling with this darn rheostat
for petes sake calvin weve got guests
stop
where
adam
yeah maybe hell call
well weve come a long way havent we i want to go home
none of this stuff was here in the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop
come on
an adult bookstore he was very excited about seeing it you think home is under a dirty bookstore in the valley
what
no no wait a minute we stopped at a porno store
you didnt stop anywhere else
we came back to the house
then what
to get some frozen poultry
well at least i fell for him before i found out he was rich thats new wait a minute he said today he knew where home was what happened this morning where did you go
i dont know i like to think so
he was always so nice how was i supposed to know thats a good thing nice is weird nice iswhat is nice its not cool ill tell you that was it ever
yeah thats thinking
have him committed
millions upon millions upon millions the cards the stock the clothes the toothpaste the guy was on the level and you blew it a man walks into your life who is the kindest most polite honest trustworthy incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life and what do you do
see these found them in the box with the cards these are stock certificates ibm att polaroid
i dont know everythings so neat its all just sogoddamn dear damn
whats wrong
well find him
and if we cant find him
give it back to him
what do you want to do with it
fallout shelter
good godyou dont think there really is a bomb shelter do you
oh well yourecertainly welcome
gay
what
oh no
i knowi know you did the right thing
well what was i supposed to do he wants me to live underground with him thats like silence of the lambs dont you think
coward
i dont think so
youre goddamn right i am
what are you going to do go over to her place and kick in the door
oh no not sophie no way please dont tell me that
its true she swept him out the door whispering little french things into his ear
what
he left with sophie
welli admit it im glad to hear that
he didnt leave with them
so now i suppose hes trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible
from the oddest place his parents told him i dont think i got that memo
where did he get all that information
exactly i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses turns out the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible thats it if you dont do that nothing else matters the cars the clothes the houses
well consider the source i dont even know what a lady is
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady
what
you know i asked him about that and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them see youd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners i didnt know that i thought it was a way of appearing superior know what else he told me
or have perfect table manners
yes you do
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean
uh yes you do
and i dont fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards
yes you do
in the first place i dont fall in love with weirdos ive only known for four or five days
what now hold on wait one damn minute
yeah im not the one whos in love with the guy
to bed
to bed
where are you going
yeah but whos not a slut these days
those sluts
hey youre the psychic eve the psychic pimp you tell me
im his pimp he left with the dancers didnt he
whats it to you
who did he leave with
we did not leave together
whats that mean
uhhe might of
he go back to the hotel
right here well youre being so bossy i wasnt sure
go to the bathroom
its not so much what you say but how you say it women like men who are unpredictable
um eve
adam i think for you we should go for sweet
well im trying to educate him its nothing personal
eve
are you kidding you wouldnt even be a crumb on her table you dont see that
for him it doesnt work for the rest of us
always good advice
just be yourself
hes from alaska
that waters freezing
no
how bout it eve can he skate around your block
let me show you the entire trousseau
i thinkitworks
well what do you think
what do you think adam
im busy tomorrow anyway i have to buy six thousand paper napkins
alright i will
thats what im sensing
yeah like ralph lauren
i see elegant
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing dont you
im sorry but if the shoe fits
well thats blunt
it means that your taste in mens apparel is as bad as your taste in men
whats that supposed to mean
youre serious arent you
money is no object hes got cards up the wazoo
i dont know
exactly you understand that dont you you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that
but first you have to start with the clothes
oh my god
give me your hand
i even guessed his hotel didnt i
oh yes
since that guy rearended me in palm springs
outoftown thats all hell say
so adamwhere on earth are you from
darlin this is xfile stuff think about it the guys got all this easily negotiable property hes obviously setting something up very big like a selfsustaining island off the coast of south america for instance or perhaps hes the head of a cult thats doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco ive heard worse
i knew youd like him
eve this guy is unbelievable
hes just a lucky guy
monsieur rick i
yes well everybody in casablanca has problems yours may work out youll excuse me
oh but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe to get to america oh but if jan should find out he is such a boy in many ways i am so much older than he is
go back to bulgaria
oh yes please
you want my advice
and he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart that would be all right wouldnt it
nobody ever loved me that much
he always has
will he keep his word
and you want to know
yes monsieur
and he is still willing to give you a visa
oh yes
does he know that
he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money
yes ill bet
yes but we have not much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult it was much more than we thought to get here and then captain renault sees us and he is so kind he wants to help us
so you decided to go to america
eight weeks we come from bulgaria oh things are very bad there monsieur a devil has the people by the throat so jan and i we we do not want our children to grow up in such a country
how long have you been married
at the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa well of course hes losing
i thought so wheres your husband
he did captain renault did
now just a minute who told you to ask me that
no i mean is he trustworthy is his word
oh hes just like any other man only more so
monsieur rick what kind of man is captain renault
no
no of course not do you mind if i do
he is well captain renaults getting broadminded sit down will you have a drink
my husband is with me too
i should have known
i came with captain renault
how did you get in here youre under age
could i speak to you for just a moment please
yes
monsieur rick
but we who are still free will do all we can we are organized monsieur underground like everywhere else tomorrow night there is a meeting at the caverne du bois if you would come
i see
as you see it was true every single time thank heaven i found you berger i am looking for a man by the name of ugarte he is supposed to help me
we read five times that you were killed in five different places
in a concentration camp one is apt to lose a little weight
i recognize you from the news photographs monsieur laszlo
a champagne cocktail please
yes monsieur
mr berger the ring could i see it again
im sorry it is
such a bargain but that is your decision
berger norwegian and at your service sir
what is your name
good
then perhaps for the lady the ring is quite unique
thank you but i hardly think
you will find a market there for this ring i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice
well
excuse me but you look like a couple who are on their way to america
yes sir
i want you to take miss lund home
yes i come i will do it
tonight he forgot
but sacha always puts out that light
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance it might attract the police
yes i come
come up here a minute
the police break up our meeting herr rick we escaped in the last moment
goodnight monsieur rick
goodnight
i wont
dont tell me where youre going
i will then i am going to the meeting of the
now you finish locking up will you carl
oh thank you herr rick sacha will be happy to hear it i owe him money
maybe i wont have to a bribe has worked before in the meantime everybody stays on salary
oh two weeks maybe three
how long can i afford to stay closed
well you are in pretty good shape herr rick
monsieur rick
no thanks carl
monsieur rick may i get you a cup of coffee
thats all right
it shall not happen again monsieur
here you are
im awfully sorry
forget it emil mistakes like that happen all the time
i am so upset monsieur rick you know i cant understand
well ill get it from the safe
excuse me monsieur rick but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs the cashier would like some money
i shall remember to pay it to myself
dont forget you owe ricks a hundred cartons of american cigarettes
well so long
of course they stay ricks wouldnt be ricks without them
and abdul and carl and sacha they stay with the place or i dont sell
hmmm i happen to know that he gets ten percent but hes worth twenty five
oh by the way my agreement with sams always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits that still goes
ah to get out of casablanca and go to america youre a lucky man
its certainly not good enough but since im in a hurry itll have to do
shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough
rick dont be a fool take me into your confidence you need a partner
thats why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place
well youre in good company renault and strasser probably think so too
rick ill put my cards on the table i think you know where those letters are
ill tell him when he comes in
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters
and the carrying charges
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters i will handle the entire transaction get rid of the letters take all the risk for a small percentage
so could i and im a poor businessman
if i could lay my hands on those letters i could make a fortune
practically no one
of course not what upsets me is the fact that ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are
youre a fat hypocrite you dont feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do
the bourbon the news about ugarte upset me very much
carrying charges my boy carrying charges here sit down theres something i want to talk over with you anyhow
i never drink in the morning and every time you send my shipment over its always just a little bit short
no hurry ill have it sent over have a drink with me
i see the bus is in ill take my shipment with me
my dear rick when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy
suppose we do
suppose we ask sam maybe hed like to make a change
suppose you run your business and let me run mine
thats too bad thats casablancas leading commodity in refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market
i dont buy or sell human beings
what do you want for sam
its not for sale at any price
you havent heard my offer
its not for sale
fine but i would like to buy your cafe
hello ferrari hows business at the blue parrot
hello rick
good day
it was gracious of you to share it with me good day mademoiselle monsieur
thank you very much good day
he is a difficult customer that rick one never knows what hell do or why but it is worth a chance
rick
not for sure monsieur but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick
do you know where they are
those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him
yes something
i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man monsieur i am moved to make one more suggestion why i do not know because it cannot possibly profit me but have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit
well good luck but be careful you know youre being shadowed
weve decided signor ferrari for the present well go on looking for two exit visas thank you very much
we might as well be frank monsieur it will take a miracle to get you out of casablanca and the germans have outlawed miracles
i will stay here and keep on trying im sure in a little while
signor ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you
as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca i am an influential and respected man it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo you however are a different matter
you see my dear the word has gone around
my dear mademoiselle perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca human life is cheap good night mademoiselle
and the other alternative
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here
what are they
there are only two other alternatives for him
what value is that you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past
uh huh under a safe conduct from me
occupied france
that is also true except for one destination to return to occupied france
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca
mademoiselle after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca
you neednt be concerned about me
and mademoiselle
she tried everything to get them and nothing worked she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me but that was all over long ago for your sake she pretended it wasnt and i let her pretend
yes
and you never will but ive got a job to do too where im going you cant follow what ive got to do you cant be any part of ilsa im no good at being noble but it doesnt take much to see that the problems of three little people dont amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world someday youll understand that now now
and i said i would never leave you
well always have paris we didnt have wed lost it until you came to casablanca we got it back last night
but what about us
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life
no
im saying it because its true inside of us we both know you belong with victor youre part of his work the thing that keeps him going if that plane leaves the ground and youre not with him youll regret it
youve got to listen to me do you have any idea what youd have to look forward to if you stayed here nine chances out of ten wed both wind up in a concentration camp isnt that true louis
but richard no i i
last night we said a great many things you said i was to do the thinking for both of us well ive done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing youre getting on that plane with victor where you belong
no richard no what has happened to you last night we said
im staying here with him til the plane gets safely away
i dont understand what about you
because youre getting on that plane
but why my name richard
oh rick
everything is quite all right
but its all right isnt it you were able to arrange everything
no not yet
richard victor thinks im leaving with him havent you told him
i wish i didnt love you so much
all right i will heres looking at you kid
i cant fight it anymore i ran away from you once i cant do it again oh i dont know whats right any longer youll have to think for both of us for all of us
all except one he wont have you
oh youll help him now richard wont you youll see that he gets out then hell have his work all that hes been living for
and laszlo
now i dont know i know that ill never have the strength to leave you again
huh but its still a story without an ending what about now
just before you and i were to leave paris together a friend came and told me that victor was alive they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris he was sick he needed me i wanted to tell you but i i didnt care i knew i knew you wouldnt have left paris and the gestapo would have caught you so i well well you know the rest
when did you first find out he was alive
oh it wasnt my secret richard victor wanted it that way not even our closest friends knew about our marriage that was his way of protecting me i knew so much about his work and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me
why werent you honest with me why did you keep your marriage a secret
it wasnt long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia they needed him in prague but there the gestapo were waiting for him just a twoline item in the paper victor laszlo apprehended sent to concentration camp i was frantic for months i tried to get word then it came he was dead shot trying to escape i was lonely i had nothing not even hope then i met you
and then
if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you you wont stop at anything all right ill make it easier for you
for the last time put them on the table
no
put them on the table
i dont have to ive got them right here
all right i tried to reason with you i tried everything now i want those letters get them for me
what of it im going to die in casablanca its a good spot for it
no oh richard im sorry im sorry but but you you are our last hope if you dont help us victor laszlo will die in casablanca
i wouldnt believe you no matter what you told me youd say anything now to get what you want
please please listen to me if you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth
i wouldnt bring up paris if i were you its poor salesmanship
richard richard we loved each other once if those days meant anything at all to you
im not fighting for anything anymore except myself im the only cause im interested in
it was your cause too in your own way you were fighting for the same thing
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause hes fighting for
i know how you feel about me but im asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important
i went through all that with your husband its no deal
you can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters
your unexpected visit isnt connected by any chance with the letters of transit it seems that as long as i have those letters ill never be lonely
please
you use richard again were back in paris
richard i had to see you
i told you this morning youd come around but this is a little ahead of schedule well wont you sit down
the stairs from the street
how did you get in
no rick no you see victor laszlo is my husband and was even when i knew you in paris
all the same someday youll lie to laszlo youll be there
well im not running away any more im settled now above a saloon its true but walk up a flight ill be expecting you
you can believe that if you want to
did you run out on me because you couldnt take it because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time
last night i saw what has happened to you the rick i knew in paris i could tell him hed understand but the one who looked at me with such hatred well ill be leaving casablanca soon and well never see each other again we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris if we leave it that way maybe well remember those days and not casablanca not last night
why not after all i got stuck with a railway ticket i think im entitled to know
i dont think i will rick
well you can tell me now im reasonably sober
yes
why did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station
it doesnt matter
im sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night
yes thats very pretty i heard a story once as a matter of fact ive heard a lot of stories in my time they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs mister i met a man once when i was a kid itd always begin huh i guess neither one of our stories was very funny tell me who was it you left me for was it laszlo or were there others in between or arent you the kind that tells
its about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo at the house of some friends she met a man about whom shed heard her whole life a very great and courageous man he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals everything she knew or ever became was because of him and she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love
well go on tell it maybe one will come to you as you go along
i dont know the finish yet
has it got a wow finish
can i tell you a story rick
well i did every one of them mostly i remember the last one a wow finish a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out
i didnt count the days

thats too far ahead to plan
all right at a quarter to five say why dont we get married in marseilles

the train for marseilles leaves at five oclock ill pick you up at your hotel at fourthirty

but be serious darling you are in danger and you must leave paris
i know very little about you just the fact that you had your teeth straightened

ah thats the new german and judging by the sound only about thirtyfive miles away
was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding
looking for a job
ten years ago lets see yes i was having a brace put on my teeth where were you
yeah its pretty bad timing where were you say ten years ago
with the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love
its the gestapo they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow
my germans a little rusty
im on their blacklist already their roll of honor
richard theyll find out your record it wont be safe for you here
well only one answer can take care of all our questions
im sorry for asking i forgot we said no questions

uh huh
why there is no other man in my life
why im so lucky why i should find you waiting for me to come along
yes
and i was wondering
im willing to be overcharged tell me
in america theyd bring only a penny i guess thats about all theyre worth
a franc for your thoughts
heres looking at you kid
we said no questions
who are you really and what were you before what did you do and what did you think huh
he hasnt played it in a long time
theres still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam
i will
say goodnight to sam for me
yes i put that dress away when the germans march out ill wear it again
i remember every detail the germans wore gray you wore blue
no
not an easy day to forget
how nice you remembered but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris
it was la belle aurore
oh i cant remember it miss ilsa im a little rusty on it
play it sam play as time goes by
i dont know what you mean miss ilsa
play it once sam for old times sake
leave him alone miss ilsa youre bad luck to him
you used to be a much better liar sam
oh he never well hes got a girl up at the blue parrot he goes up there all the time
does he always leave so early
not tonight no more he aint coming uh he went home
when will he be back
i dont know i aint seen him all night
where is rick
yes maam
some of the old songs sam
yes maam a lot of water under the bridge
its been a long time
hello miss ilsa i never expected to see you again
hello sam
yes im ready goodbye rick god bless you
are you ready ilsa
of course ill be careful
be careful
you dont even have to say it ill believe goodnight dear
yes yes i know victor whatever i do will you believe that i that
i love you very much my dear
no victor there isnt
i know how it is to be lonely is there anything you wish to tell me
yes victor i was
when i was in the concentration camp were you lonely in paris
yes
ilsa i
yes he said ask your wife i dont know why he said that
ask me
he suggested i ask you
did he give any reason
but no intention of selling them one would think if sentiment wouldnt persuade him money would
yes
apparently he has the letters
whatever id say youd carry on victor why dont you tell me about rick what did you find out
to tell you the truth i am frightened too shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding or shall i carry on the best i can
dont joke after major strassers warning tonight i am frightened
i must besides it isnt often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife
victor please dont go to the underground meeting tonight
our faithful friend is still there
well discuss it later
what happened with rick
and as far away from major strasser as possible
he does could we have a table close to him
i meant to but something always held me up i love you very much ilsa
yes i see when i had trouble getting out of lille why didnt you leave me there and when i was sick in marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why didnt you leave me then
yes i would
but victor if the situation were different if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it
no ilsa i wont let you stay here you must get to america and believe me somehow i will get out and join you
no victor no
please ilsa dont be hasty
we are only interested in two visas signor
goodnight
goodnight
goodnight
goodnight
i will dont worry
be careful
i must find out what berger knows
we have been in difficult places before havent we
victor im afraid for you
this time they really mean to stop me
wont you join us
you are very kind
if we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us perhaps ugartes in some other part of the cafe
victor i i feel somehow we shouldnt stay here
youre saying this only to make me go
im afraid major strasser would insist
i wasnt sure you were the same lets see the last time we met
i cant get over you two she was asking about you earlier rick in a way that made me extremely jealous
this is mr laszlo
well then perhaps you also
oh youve already met rick mademoiselle
hello rick
well mademoiselle hes the kind of a man that well if i were a woman and i were not around i should be in love with rick but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man
is what
mademoiselle you are in ricks and rick is
rick whos he
he came from paris with rick
yes
sam
captain the boy who is playing the piano somewhere i have seen him
here it is
i understand
but you didnt know she was at my place last night when you were she came there for the letters of transit isnt that true ilsa
yes
im going to anyway because it may make a difference to you later on you said you knew about ilsa and me
monsieur blaine i dont ask you to explain anything
all except one thing theres something you should know before you leave
everything in order
good ive got the letters right here all made out in blank
no its all arranged
oh never mind about that you wont have any trouble in lisbon will you
but we made a deal
keep it youll need it in america
i brought the money monsieur blaine
oh save it weve still lots of things to do
monsieur blaine i dont know how to thank you
apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause well i am also a human being
you love her that much
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect i know for instance that you are in love with a woman it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman the first evening i came here in this cafe i knew there was something between you and ilsa since no one is to blame i i demand no explanation i ask only one thing you wont give me the letters of transit all right but i want my wife to be safe i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca
you seem to know all about my destiny
i wonder if you do i wonder if you know that youre trying to escape from yourself and that youll never succeed
yes i get the point
you know how you sound monsieur blaine like a man whos trying to convince himself of something he doesnt believe in his heart each of us has a destiny for good or for evil
what of it then itll be out of its misery
we might as well question why we breathe if we stop breathing well die if we stop fighting our enemies the world will die
dont you sometimes wonder if its worth all this i mean what youre fighting for
yes rather
had a close one eh
thank you
well this might come in handy
my wife
i said ask your wife
i beg your pardon
there is i suggest that you ask your wife
there must be some reason why you wont let me have them
my friend you could make it a million francs or three my answer would still be the same
ill raise it to two hundred thousand
i appreciate it but i dont accept it
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs
yes i found that a very expensive hobby too but then i never was much of a businessman
isnt it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog
what of it
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record you ran guns to ethiopia you fought against the fascists in spain
im not interested in politics the problems of the world are not in my department im a saloon keeper
you must know its very important i get out of casablanca its my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement you know what i have been doing you know what it means to the work to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that i be free to reach america and continue my work
right
my office
well isnt there some other place its rather confidential what i have to say
go ahead
monsieur blaine i wonder if i could talk to you
i take that as a great compliment to sam i suppose he means to you paris of well happier days
good evening you see here we are again
good evening
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table
good morning
any time
well come again
not at all
i hope we didnt overstay our welcome
we all try you succeed
thank you i try
your work
what for
and i congratulate you
wont you join us for a drink
and about victor laszlo everywhere
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca
how do you do
how do you do
are you quite finished with us
i am making out the report now we havent quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape
nothing important but may i speak to him now
i believe you have a message for him
yes
by the way monsieur last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte
thank you
monsieur insofar as it is in my power
i was in a german concentration camp for a year thats honor enough for a lifetime
and the honor of having served the third reich
well perhaps i shall like it in casablanca
i am afraid not my regrets monsieur
thank you
with pleasure wont you sit down
may we proceed with the business
thats strange nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca
i slept very well
i am delighted to see you both did you have a good nights rest
goodnight
well be there
tomorrow at ten at the prefects office
so it is and we have a curfew here in casablanca it would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself
ilsa i dont wish to be the one to say it but its late
ricky youre becoming quite human i suppose we have to thank you for that mademoiselle
this is a very interesting cafe i congratulate you
well a precedent is being broken er emil
no two champagne cocktails please
my bill
very well
let us say that it is my request that is a much more pleasant word
no please monsieur it is a little game we play they put it on the bill i tear the bill up it is very convenient
no captain please
i was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit casablanca that was a gross understatement
thank you i hope youll forgive me captain but the present french administration has not always been so cordial may i present miss ilsa lund
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay it is not often we have so distinguished a visitor
yes what is it you want
i am captain renault prefect of police
yes
monsieur laszlo is it not
good day
for the time being
you wont dare to interfere with me here this is still unoccupied france any violation of neutrality would reflect on captain renault
herr laszlo you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand but in one respect you are mistaken you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced but there is one exception no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape
and what if you track down these men and kill them what if you murdered all of us from every corner of europe hundreds thousands would rise to take our places even nazis cant kill that fast
if i didnt give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal i certainly wont give them to you now
you will give us the names
yes even in berlin if you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts you will have your visa in the morning
even in berlin
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris in prague in brussels in amsterdam in oslo in belgrade in athens
and that is
dont be in such a hurry you have all the time in the world you may be in casablanca indefinitely or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow on one condition
is that all you wish to tell us
not at all captain renaults signature is necessary on every exit visa captain would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa
whether or not you succeed is of course problematical
very well herr laszlo we will not mince words you are an escaped prisoner of the reich so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us you have reached casablanca it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca
captain renault i am under your authority is it your order that we come to your office
then we shall state another time and another place tomorrow at ten in the prefects office with mademoiselle
this is hardly the time or the place
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil
ive never accepted that privilege and im now on french soil
you were a czechoslovakian now you are a subject of the german reich
im sure youll excuse me if i am not gracious but you see major strasser im a czechoslovakian
ask monsieur rick
why do you stand here why dont you stop him
victor laszlo is on that plane
what is the meaning of that phone call
find one
but i have no excuse to close it
yes much too good a time the place is to be closed
but everybodys having such a good time
you see what i mean if laszlos presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in casablanca bring on i advise that this place be shut up at once
i see what you mean
uh huh i have been thinking it is too dangerous if we let him go it may be too dangerous if we let him stay
a leader like laszlo
we are concerned about more than casablanca we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader
and if it should change
i have no conviction if thats what you mean i blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy
captain renault are you entirely certain which side youre on
my dear major we are trying to cooperate with your government but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people
you see captain the situation is not as much under control as you believe
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here
as to laszlo we want him watched twentyfour hours a day
but we mustnt underestimate american blundering i was with them when they blundered into berlin in
you give him credit for too much cleverness my impression was that hes just another blundering american
if rick has the letters hes much too smart to let you find them there
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr blaine i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
perhaps
you see major you have nothing to worry about rick
i admit he is very clever three times he slipped through our fingers in paris he continued his activities we intend not to let it happen again
of course one must admit he has great courage
you werent always so carefully neutral we have a complete dossier on you
rick is completely neutral about everything and that takes in the field of women too
how about new york
ho diplomatist
do you mind if i ask you a few questions unofficially of course
well personally major i will take what comes
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others
how do you do mr rick
rick this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich
i expected no less captain
especially so tonight major in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers
thank you
may i recommend veuve cliquot a good french wine
champagne and a tin of caviar
thank you it is a pleasure to have you here major
good evening captain
good evening gentlemen
i have already heard about this cafe and also about mr rick himself
oh there is no hurry tonight hell be at ricks everybody comes to ricks
realizing the importance of the case my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects
by the way the murder of the couriers what has been done
what else my dear major
oh we germans must get used to all climates from russia to the sahara but perhaps you were not referring to the weather
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm major
major strasser my aide lieutenant casselle
thank you captain its very good to be here
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca
louis i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
uh huh
our expenses
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses
my letter of transit i could use a trip but it doesnt make any difference about our bet you still owe me ten thousand francs
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while theres a free french garrison over at brazzaville i could be induced to arrange a passage
i think perhaps youre right
maybe but it seemed like a good time to start
well rick youre not only a sentimentalist but youve become a patriot
as soon as the plane goes louis
i suppose you know this isnt going to be pleasant for either of us especially for you ill have to arrest you of course
anyway thanks for helping me out
what you just did for laszlo and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him i know a little about women my friend she went but she knew you were lying
stay where you are i dont know what youre talking about
well i was right you are a sentimentalist
and the names are mr and mrs victor laszlo
you think of everything dont you
if you dont mind you fill in the names that will make it even more official
that is my least vulnerable spot
just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them and remember this guns pointed right at your heart
call off your watchdogs you said
i do weve got plenty of time to discuss that later
i suppose you know what youre doing but i wonder if you realize what this means
put that gun down
i have sit down over there
have you taken leave of your senses
not so fast louis nobodys going to be arrested not for a while yet
serves me right for not being musical
sams piano
tell me when we searched the place where were they
i have the letters right here
is everything ready
yes i know what you mean but ive already spoken to ferrari youll still win at roulette
you know this place will never be the same without you ricky
oh he wont be followed here
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel so i knew id be on time
youre late
go ahead ricky
oh thanks
ricky im going to miss you apparently youre the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i
ill make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitors pen
i see how do i know youll keep your end of the bargain
well she isnt just any woman
theres still something about this business i dont quite understand miss lund shes very beautiful yes but you were never interested in any woman
ill arrange to have laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit and thatll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest you get him and we get away to the germans that last will be just a minor annoyance
then release him you be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves
it certainly would germany vichy would be very grateful
ilsa is laszlos wife she probably knows things that strasser would like to know louis ill make a deal with you instead of this petty charge you have against him you can get something really big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years that would be quite a feather in your cap wouldnt it
you didnt come here to tell me this you have the letters of transit you can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please why are you interested in what happens to laszlo
ilsa lund that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape the last man i want to see in america
what friend
and im taking a friend with me one youll appreciate
huh
youre not very subtle but you are effective i i get the point yes i have the letters but i intend using them myself im leaving casablanca on tonights plane the last plane
dont count too much on my friendship ricky in this matter im powerless besides i might lose ten thousand francs
well theyre all excellent reasons
because one youve bet ten thousand francs hed escape two you have the letters of transit now dont bother to deny it and well you might do it simply because you dont like strassers looks as a matter of fact i dont like him either
what makes you think id stick my neck out for laszlo
ricky id advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo if by any chance you were to help him escape
but you havent any actual proof and you know it this isnt germany or occupied france all you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days you might as well let him go now
i am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
how can you close me up on what grounds
well i forgive you this time but ill be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde and it will make me very happy if she loses uh huh
put it down as a gesture to love
why do you interfere with my little romances
yeah why
as i suspected youre a rank sentimentalist
who knows in her own way she may constitute an entire second front i think its time for me to flatter major strasser a little ill see you later rick
so yvonnes gone over to the enemy
huh
well it looks like youre a little late
serves me right for asking a direct question the subject is closed
louis are you provichy or free french
well i told strasser he wouldnt find the letters here but i told my men to be especially destructive you know how that impresses germans rick have you got these letters of transit
that was some goingover your men gave my place this afternoon we just barely got cleaned up in time to open
well ricky im very pleased with you now youre beginning to live like a frenchman
another precedent gone this has been a very interesting evening ill call you a cab gasoline rationing time of night
oh its my party
thanks i will
oh no rick never
hello ilsa
well you were asking about rick and here he is mademoiselle may i present
i was born in new york city if thatll help you any
that makes rick a citizen of the world
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich
oh how do you do
excuse me
yeah you were saying
oh i see gestapo spank
i have my orders
maybe well it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here
the winning side would have paid you much better
and got well paid for it on both occasions
oh laugh if you will but i happen to be familiar with your record let me point out just two items in you ran guns to ethiopia in you fought in spain on the loyalist side
because my dear ricky i suspect that under that cynical shell youre at heart a sentimentalist
louis whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape
it doesnt matter there is no exit visa for him
maybe hes not quite as romantic as you are
i think not i have seen the lady and if he did not leave her in marseilles or in oran he certainly wont leave her in casablanca
hell take one
he is traveling with a lady
why two
done no matter how clever he is he still needs an exit visa or i should say two
okay
make it ten i am only a poor corrupt official
i just paid out twenty id like to get it back
is that a serious offer
twenty thousand francs says it isnt
this is the end of the chase
stop it he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe
oh but i just told you
his escape
manages what
itll be interesting to see how he manages
it is my duty to see that he doesnt impress the other half rick laszlo must never reach america he stays in casablanca
well hes succeeded in impressing half the world
rick that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed
victor laszlo
victor laszlo
yeah whats his name
that is another reason there is a man whos arrived in casablanca on his way to america he will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa
i thought it was because we let you win at roulette
thank you rick there are many exit visas sold in this cafe but we know that you have never sold one that is the reason we permit you to remain open
yeah have a brandy
how observant you are as a matter of fact i wanted to give you a word of advice
perhaps not
i see and whats strasser doing here he certainly didnt come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency
our entertainment is enough
you know rick we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here it will amuse your customers
a wise foreign policy
i stick my neck out for nobody
if you are thinking of warning him dont put yourself out he cannot possibly escape
this is no ordinary arrest a murderer no less
what again
rick theres going to be some excitement here tonight we are going to make an arrest in your cafe
huh
i was misinformed
waters what waters were in the desert
my health i came to casablanca for the waters
and what in heavens name brought you to casablanca
it was a combination of all three
the clipper to america
why whats in lisbon
the plane to lisbon you would like to be on it
when it comes to women youre a true democrat
you know i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne maybe get her on the rebound eh
how extravagant you are throwing away women like that someday they may be scarce
hello louis
take your hands off me
come on were going to get your coat
sacha call a cab
rick im sick and tired of having you
dont listen to him sacha fill it up
sacha shes had enough
give me another
i never make plans that far ahead
will i see you tonight
thats so long ago i dont remember
where were you last night
put it down
get me the radio tower
put that phone down
hello
i was willing to shoot captain renault and im willing to shoot you
i would advise you not to interfere
good evening mr blaine
youll excuse me gentlemen your business is politics mine is running a saloon
victor laszlo published the foulest lies in the prague newspapers until the very day we marched in and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar
not particularly i understand the point of view of the hound too
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox huh
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one
you will forgive my curiosity mr blaine the point is an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us
are my eyes really brown
i havent the slightest idea
aha who do you think will win the war
well there are certain sections of new york major that i wouldnt advise you to try to invade
its not particularly my beloved paris
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris
there seems to be no secret about that
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation
im a drunkard
what is your nationality
make it official if you like
rick hide me do something you must help me rick do something
dont be a fool you cant get away
rick rick help me
dont be afraid of that please keep them for me thank you i knew i could trust you
i dont want them here overnight
perhaps an hour perhaps a little longer
for how long
one moment tonight ill be selling those for more money than even i have ever dreamed of and then addio casablanca you know rick i have many friends in casablanca but somehow just because you despise me youre the only one i trust will you keep these for me please
myself i found myself much more reasonable
who did you bribe for your visa renault or yourself
well rick after tonight ill be through with the whole business and i am leaving finally this casablanca
i dont mind a parasite i object to a cutrate one
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renaults price i get it for them for half is that so parasitic
for a price ugarte for a price
but why oh you object to the kind of business i do huh but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i didnt help them thats not so bad through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas
if i gave you any thought i probably would
i forgot you never drink with ill have another please you despise me dont you
no
thank you will you have a drink with me please
you are a very cynical person rick if youll forgive me for saying so
they got a lucky break yesterday they were just two german clerks today theyre the honored dead
may i too bad about those two german couriers wasnt it
you thought what
oh nothing but when you first came to casablanca i thought
well what makes you think i havent
huh you know rick watching you just now with the deutsches bank one would think youd been doing this all your life
hello ugarte
uh excuse me please hello rick
no mr richard i cant find her
where is she have you seen her
the germansll be here pretty soon now and theyll come looking for you and dont forget theres a price on your head
and getting closer every minute here drink up well never finish the other three
you said it heres looking at you kid
this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied doesnt it mr richard
yes boss
if she can stand it i can play it
well i dont think i can remember it
you played it for her and you can play it for me
no i dont
well stop it you know what i want to hear
just a little something of my own
whats that youre playing
i bet theyre asleep in new york ill bet theyre asleep all over america
uh my watch stopped
sam if its december in casablanca what time is it in new york

i like it fine here
sam ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot
i just hope he wont expect us to say grace all the time
dr homer wells
i suppose it wouldnt hurt to meet him whats his name again
you dont find it depressing that homer wells is picking apples

im sorry for what i said about wally needing you it was unnecessary
i know you dont think much of being needed or of me for that matter
sure thanks
this came for you a couple of days ago olive asked me to bring it with everything happening i guess she forgot
she knows how to take care of herself
do you think shell be all right

mr rose knows
you dont understand its her father
well we cant force her its her decision
she wont go to st clouds

its a good thing i didnt have that baby isnt it
okay okayi know you do too
no thats not all there is to it i love you tooi know i do
fine thats all there is to it then
i grew up with wally i began my adult life with him

im just waiting and seeing like you said
olive told me you might have told me yourself
we have to wait and see i think that for everything in life you have to wait and see
what will be okay
it will be okay

right
i know this was right
nobody will swim here until next summer by then the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sandthere wont be any sharp edges
arent you worried that people will cut their feet

thats what id come here for id watch the movie

how could you not care about the movie
the speaker for the movie sound
ahha so what is thata radio
sometimes movies mostly bore wally
did you come here with wallyto not watch movies
privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies
just a little privacy
i never asked for any responsibility
but you had so much responsibility
i miss things i miss people i miss reading to the boys
you dont miss it
i didnt say that growing up in an orphanage youre always lonely youre just never alone
at least you were never lonely
it was my favorite night at the orphanagemovie night wed race into the dining hall of course everyone wanted to sit in front so wed be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing
what are you so crazy about the movies for
yes and no when you come here you dont really care about the movie
the screen is enormous imagine king kong up there have you seen a lot of movies here
you think maybe i was i love this place
youre a natural you were born to drive a car like this
well she was in a weakened condition i dont know what about king kong is that medically possible
whats the medical explanation
oh sure
she was torn apart she died of a broken heart
and what did she die of exactly
she did love him how many women have you known
first she loved him then she didnt then no one else could have him
i did like it all i said was its not king kong
but you looked as if you liked it
king kong its really good
youve seen only one movie which one
yes ive only seen one though
when they watched at all do you like movies
people watched the movies in their cars
yes but its closed all the time now because of the blackout
a movie outside
i dont think mr rose would leave without you

youre one of the best curlywe couldnt let just anyone take you
nobody ever wants me
they wanted a girl
i thought they might take me
does he know hes supposed to be in india does he even want to come back
edna come dance with me lets be foolish tonight
i just wanted to ask you
i wouldnt worry edna that he doesnt have money if he gets hungry he can pick his dinner
he probably doesnt make much money picking appleshe must have had to pay to send them too
or that he cant be bothered to write us a proper letter a dissertation on apples we dont need
but what about school records homer doesnt have any diplomas
so here is my candidate what do you think
well we can only guess about that edna they are against the law
you mean theyll replace you with someone who wont perform abortions
graduated bowdoin college and harvard school of medicine
homer was born here in what was it
homer wells born portland maine march
hes leaving
i dont know hes just leaving youre the one who says he needs to see the world thats what hell dohell see the world

the trees are flakantiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground

i think you been stayin up too late at night homer
is it true
i didnt see where you was pickin this mornin homer but you musta worked up a big appetite you look like youre serious about gettin to your lunch today
you still doin it too fast
this is easyim not hurrying
slow down homerdont be in such a big hurry
of course theres worms homer and what is them worms really they just protein them worms they is good for you
what about the worms most of these apples are the dropsoff the ground right there have to be worms
cider dont have no taste till later in octoberits too watery now when were usin just them early macs and them gravensteins you dont get no good cider till youre pickin them golden delicious and them winter bananas them baldwins and them russerts

are we supposed to be up here the rules said
i guess so
thats better i can tell you got yourself some education thems good hands you got homer them hands you got they know what theyre doin aint that right
okay
stop it homer they arent our rules we didnt write them i dont see no reason to read them

its big enough to keep you out of the war i suppose aint that right
out back theres a shed its just a mess if that shed was better organized i could put my truck in there
so what should i do now
you know everything i know plus what youve taught yourselfyoure a better doctor then i am and you know it
i am not a doctor
its your heartyou ought to take it with you
i dont need thisi know all about my condition
i dont need your gratitude
you know im grateful for everything youve done for me
are you really so stupid that you imagine youre going to find a more gratifying life what youre going to find is people like the poor people who get left hereonly nobody takes care of them as well and you wont be able to take care of them either theres no taking care of anybody not out there
of course
in other parts of the world i suppose there are other ways
i wasnt intending to leave here in order to be entirely uselessi expect ill find some ways to be of use
doubtless youll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do
happy to be alive under any circumstancesis that your point
try to look at it this way buster and i are sitting right here beside you we could have ended up in the incinerator
try to look at it this way what choice does buster have what are his options nobody will ever adopt him
im happy i amuse you
its just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people
how about this child you expect her to be responsible
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with
it is ill get this you go ahead
i thought it was my turn
its your splice you blame me for everything
i thought you took care of this it always breaks in the same place its your splice isnt it
we havent had a wilbur here in a year or so have we we used to have dozens
okay hes just a wilbur then
im not crazy about the little
henceforth you shall be little wilbur

i dont think so
cant a boy be a dorrit
he doesnt like it hes a boy thats why
its my turn
nobodys named this one yet
wheres the name sheet
when doesnt he have bronchitis i wouldnt call his bronchial infections underdeveloped would you
but isnt fuzzy just well underdeveloped
i havent either but you will the morons who write the books should do a little research here
i havent read that
fuzzy is not uncommon i tell you theres something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers they seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along
good boy good job and you call yourself not a doctor keep an eye on hershes in trouble
in other words scurvy
if you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c
i dont know it
christ its oil of tansy
obviously
its obviously an aborticide
scurvy ah yes the curse of the old time sailor suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables homer dorothy isnt a sailor
it looks like scurvy
no the fetus was dead her uterus was virtually disintegratingmy stitches pulled right through the tissue
there was no visible wound
what else could i have showed you homer the only thing i can teach you is what i know in every life youve got to be of use
one its illegal two i didnt ask how to do ityou just showed me
you know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they cant get help anywhere else
all i said was i dont want to perform abortions i have no argument with you performing them
i presume youd prefer handling the delivery
yes for both
first pregnancy
right
goodbye arthur homer ill see you tomorrow
just promise me that if theres a blizzard youll move into wallys room until its over
uh sure

who cares
anyway i was just showing you this guy as an example of whats available i didnt think youd be interested
i fail to see how a little christianity could hurt anyone here
then i suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him
you cant think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is
does it snow in bombay one winter here and well be shipping him south in a coffin
i fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissedthat part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here
no i dont want to know him hes doing missionary workin india i wrote him weeks ago but hes either too holy or too busy to answer maybe he got killed in the war
do you know him
who live here in this cider house peaches who grind them apples who press that cider who clean up the mess and who just plain live here just breathin in the vinegar somebody who dont live here made them rules them rules aint for us we the ones who make up them rules we makin our own rules every day aint that right homer

you rat
i cant i want to but i have to study
come over after im done here
i was not
you were not
i just thought id say hi i was in the neighborhood
i think i know i think we can help why dont you start by telling me about your relationship everything you can think of everything about him everything about you and well take it from there
maybe gay isnt the right word but anyway its been rough with him whatever the fuck he is heheh my significant other heh heh and i guess on a certain level i want to break it off but i feel yknow its like this constant questioning and re questioning do i end it should i give it more time im not happy but what do i expect relationships require work you know the drill the thing that i keep coming back to is im not getting any younger i want to have a baby at some point maybe right so then i think i should settle which is not necessarily the best word i mean hes a good guy its not really settling then i think maybe im just a victim of movies yknow that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be but then i think no this is what i really want so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it you know agreed but then i think he is a good guy and its complicated yknow
what no i dont like the term boyfriend its so gay
you guess hes your boyfriend or you guess youre having a bad time with him
well ive been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend i guess
well why dont you tell me whats going on do you mind if i turn this on
okay i guess
how are you today
i just wanted to say that come by my house
what old mill is that somewhere we
yay meet me after work by the old mill
i cant stop thinking about you
youre still excited by my irreverence you havent yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock
we should have sex its old hat for us
i sort of do but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality cleaned up enough to be erotic
says you were constantly calling me a slob its sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overlyfamiliar and bored dont you think
says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
doesnt sound like me
i dont know
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
well sounds like me sorry man says you were jealous and suspicious
thats what it says you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
a bully moi
says you were a bully
says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling
im nervous because i have and enormous crush on you
well you obviously dont know me
yeah i wouldnt have thought that
im nervous too
and im just too nervous around you right now
hey joel

because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
oh um

joel come here please
i think i should go back

i love her
have you ever read any anna akhmatova

i saw you sitting over here by yourself i thought thank god someone normal who doesnt know how interact at these things either
you said
hi

it would be different if we could just give it another go around

i still thought you were going to save me even after that
probably
you had the whole human race pegged
i had you pegged didnt i
i remember that speech really well
joel im not a concept i want you to just keep that in your head too many guys think im a concept or i complete them or im going to make them alive but im just a fuckedup girl who is looking for my own peace of mind dont assign me yours

i dropped you off after you said
and i didnt have an argument

he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased
really is he cute
theres this guy i heard him talking in my apartment hes one of the eraser guys and he fell for you when they were erasing you so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now youre dating him
what
theres this guy
another rainy day whatever shall we do
i came over to the bed and you smelled so good like you just woke up slightly sweaty and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like

i hired them to were in my brain but i want it to stop before i wake up and dont know you anymore
oh
yes indeed fuck theyre erasing you clem
such a beautiful view
its my favorite book since i was a kid its about these toys theres this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real i cant believe im crying already he says it takes a long time thats why it doesnt often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby but these things dont matter at all because once you are real you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand
no
do you know the velveteen rabbit
yeah tangerine
joely

joel youre a liar
i just dont have anything very interesting about my life
i want to know you

i would like you to call me would you do that i would like that
okay
i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so
you should stay
sounds good but right now i should go
ill pack a picnic a night picnic night picnics are different and
yeah oh great
okay
i dont believe in that soulmate crap anymore but he says so many great things we like the same writers this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to and hes cute its fucked up joel you should come up to the charles with me sometime
i think so
exactly i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but i was really disappointment to be there with him yknow and thats where psychic stuff comes in like it just isnt right with him yknow
thats scary sounding
that made me cry but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river it gets frozen this time of year
oh yeah
well for the last week anyway hes kind of a kid kind of a goofball but hes really stuck on me which is flattering who wouldnt like that and hes like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart hes the one who gave me that crow photograph
i dont either i used to but im through with that yknow if i dont love my body then im just lost you know with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart thats coming round the bend so ive been seeing this guy
no not at all
im nervous you dont need to be nervous around me though i like you do you think im repulsively fat
no
youre very nice god i have to stop saying that youre nervous around me huh
yeah
like i wanted to talk to you i didnt need any more reason to do it who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist
yeah i think so its hard to
whats the goal joel my goal joel is to just let it flow through me do you know what i mean its like theres all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think were all taught we should be consistent yknow you love someone thats it forever you choose to do something with your life thats it thats what you do its a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through and my feeling is thats how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing you know
yeah
and anyway you sell yourself short i can tell theres a lot of stuff going on in your brain i can tell my goal can i tell you my goal
thanks
i like you thats the thing about my psychic thing i think thats my greatest psychic power that i get a sense about people my problem is i never trust it but i get it and with you i get that youre a really good guy
i do have a tendency to use that word too much
youre really nice im sorry i yelled at you before about it god im an idiot
i think about that
oh does that make you sad or anxious im always anxious thinking im not living my life to the fullest yknow taking advantage of every possibility just making sure that im not wasting one second of the little time i have
sorry my life isnt that interesting i go to work i go home i dont know what to say
its helpful to think theres some order to things youre kind of closed mouthed arent you
but i think i am i like to think i am
yeah i guess
exactly exactly thats exactly my feeling about it its hard to know like okay but how many times do i think something and it doesnt happen thats what youre saying right you forget about those times right
yeah i dont know its hard to know
me neither but sometimes i have premonitions so i dont know maybe thats just coincidence right yknow you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it yknow
i dont know
well i go to a psychic and shes always telling me im psychic she should know do you believe in that stuff
yeah
yknow im sort of psychic
drink up young man itll make the whole seduction part less repugnant
thanks
i know a man who needs a refill
no i
no stay just for a little while refill
well i should probably get going
i dont know i cant see them from here joel just pick something good
you just say im not really

look i have to go i have to think
i know i spoke to my friend magda
its true
thats what you have to say how could it be true i never even heard of any procedure like this its a joke
maybe its true then its my voice on the tape
i mean i havent even told anyone ive met you who would even know to do this
i probably got the same thing as you
did you send this is it a joke
yeah
tomorrow night honeymoon on ice
i guess so
ha ha you said i do i guess that means were married
oddly enough i do
hmmm do you miss me
i just walked in
what took you so long
there you are naomi its just im afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had
thats me
long day thinking
i just got in
yeah i tried you at home did you get my message
i know i had to take the day to think
good i called you at work today they said you were home sick
hows it going
hi
hi naomi its joel
i didnt want to go i was too nervous i thought maybe you were a nut but you were exciting you called from upstairs
i really should go i really need to catch my ride
i couldnt believe you did that i was paralyzed with fear
clementine
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf
so youre still on the zoloft
but i went back to my food the next thing i remember i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye
i remember being drawn to you even then i thought i love this woman because shes alone down there looking out at the black ocean
your back to me in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually at the time i thought how cool an orange sweatshirt
this is it the night we met my god its over
okay i wish you could come
on the couch dark quiet i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times i thought i could take it back erase it explain i had momentarily lost my mind then i told myself we werent happy that was the truth that what we were was safe it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasnt much fun but i wanted fun i saw other people having fun and i wanted it then i thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun im being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit then i thought maybe not maybe not and then i thought as i always do at this point in my argument about dying
naomi
i didnt want to do this but i had to or they wouldve called me a girl
i cant i have to go home ill do it later
i loved you on this day i love this memory the rain us just hanging
shes so sexy
is that like us are we just bored with each other
hows the chicken
and what are you like a wino
right she called me an old lady here too and i remember i said
any messages carmen
i wasnt going to call her not after the way she was
so then she just stops calling
oh god i miss her i cant believe shes with that guy now im never going to see her again i love her so much what a fucking monster she is
gotta get home how could she do this to me how could she not care about what we meant to each other what a fuck what a fucking monster she is
thats your look for me
clementine
maybe if i just explain what happened i wouldnt have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and
i love you and if you knew that if i told you what happened ill explain everything what we meant to each other ill tell you everything about our time together youll know everything again and
clementine i should just maybe talk to her
i should maybe talk to you
its too late
its them
the pill was pink i remember it had some letters and numbers on it what were they al al something four digits i dont like taking pills when i dont know what they are i have no choice
pink there was a number on it i remember al i have to follow through with this i have no choice
fuck you clementine
maybe im making a mistake maybe i just need to learn to live with this first of all ill get over it secondly it happened those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it who said that churchill im not sure but i dont care she did it to me i have to rid myself of this fuck her
i might be making a mistake
im like a joke to them
the driver waved so casual friendly
there are two of them couldnt make them out the orange glow of a cigarette
it was snowing
yes but im just something youre imagining what can i do im in your head too
im trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased stop it now
what what do you mean
you have to stop this
we can help you through this why dont you start now by telling me everything you can remember about
it was a mess i dont know how it got this way
we can help you through this why dont you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine
well i did
im sorry you saw one of our notification cards you never should have
well technically the procedure itself is brain damage but on a par with a night of heavy drinking nothing youll miss
is there any sort of risk of brain damage
well start with your most recent memories and go backwards there is an emotional core to each of our memories as we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process by the time you wake up in the morning all memories weve targeted will have withered and disappeared like a dream upon waking
night
well speak soon
so im going to get some sleep im glad youre okay
i had a good time last night i really did
okay joel i suppose youre right
i dont know im not sure theres a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny
so you think the dissertation will get published
im glad you called
im sorry i really shouldnt have
a religion instructor at columbia a good guy hes a good guy
oh great thats great
miss you too i have been seeing someone for a little while
i miss you
oh sweetie it really does cut both ways we were taking each other for granted and
well it was my fault the break up im sorry
im sorry

the thing is joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off youre just going to be joel with the same fucking problems
no i just need some space maybe
bullshit who is it you met someone
i think maybe were both so used to operating at this level that how can one person be unhappy if one person is unhappy both have to be by definition
dont say we when you mean you
yknow weve been i dont know sort of unhappy with each other and
what
i dont know ive just been thinking maybe were not happy with each other
so whats going on joel
dont do this to me now joel really

its an apartment
yeah that looks better thanks
does that help
then check the connections
the voltage looks fine
thats your problem
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when im living on an isolated ridgetop with delores
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics all in siwash cave in a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools it would have to rely on its wits and its senses it would have to live with animals and plants as virtual equals its extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve
the world isnt going to end you dummy i hope you know that much but it is going to change its going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue but there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption it isnt merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative politicaleconomic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but therell be some of us itll miss little pockets of humanity like the clock people like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave theres almost no worldwide calamity famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you couldnt survive in that cave
well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard
easy come easy go
but thats an old story now i cant believe that you would leave the butte
you mean shes dead
she had a one wayticket to kansas city
i want to go back to the clock people i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what theyre up to whats happened to jelly
the countess has come to our aid the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls and i have been asked to oversee the ranch for a week and as it turns out the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was heres a picture
yes everything is getting worse but everything is also getting better
is everything getting worse
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
what do you believe in then
the clock people mistook me for chinese and the name stuck in the same way that all indian tribes came to be labeled indians through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges it is only fitting that indians misnamed me the clock people however are not a tribe rather they are a gathering of indians from various tribes they have lived together since
then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp as a japaneseamerican i had been put there and watched over i found refuge with the clock people who discovered me in a snow bank near dead i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains
the clock people
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe ha ha ho ho and hee hee
he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this faraway siwash ridge i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own
siwash huh
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people
clockworks
clockworks
what was that
neither do i ha ha ho ho hee hee
but i dont know how to polka
save your breath for the climb
oh well theres been some trouble on the ranch i came up here to get out of the way its so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down if you could help
i know who you are
im a friend of bonanza jellybeans
aw hes some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out west gives my ranch the creeps and the willies too but though he be old and dirty hes alive ill bet clear down to his toes they dont have his juice in a jar in new haven well i suppose that ill have to write sissy out on the road
what guy
chinks the guys name for christs sake
if we ivy leaguers arent earthy enough to suit you hillbillies at least we dont go around indulging in racist terms such as chink next thing i know youll be calling me chief
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools anyway strap you down and pump the nature out of you they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck why send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all hed be fit for would be a desk in the militaryindustrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy jesus hms christ if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters theyd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps oogie boogie
i suppose it was mine yes it definitely was my fault
whose fault was that
oh we didnt get it all the way on
shit o dear julian do you mean to tell me you didnt get it on
well er
what do you think
like what
how does she like what in bed
she always leaves town you dummy that doesnt mean anything what about in bed how does she like it in bed
i think shes disappointed that im not more ah sort of atavistic shes got some naive sentimental notions about indians im sure she liked me though but then she left town
ninety degrees to the left i hope how does she feel about you
countess im really in a dither shes turned my head
its high time you realized honey babe that a woman doesnt have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language
oh you im not talking about her hands theyre difficult to ignore i confess but im speaking of her whole being her whole being is extraordinary the way she talks for example shes so articulate
shes obviously that jesus which would you rather have a million dollars or one of sissys thumbs full of pennies
extraordinary
sissy youre trying to protect those scuzzy bitches well let your conscience be your guide as my mommy used to say but it wont work those stinking sluts are going to suffer
i dont know anything about it
sissy dont play dumb with me youre a good model but a shitty actress the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance you know perfectly well they are last seen in nebraska didnt make it to canada siwash lake is between nebraska and canada the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake and who else but jellybeans wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds how much do you know about it have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows
good good good youll enjoy it youll see julian is a gentleman
well okay ill try it i dont see the point in it but ill try it just for you its kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in new york city however
i cant be certain that you would but what have you got to lose
what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship
yes well what im getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity she cant wait too long you know now theres no reason why you must lose yours i mean just ponder it a bit thats all
why yes technically jack kerouac and i came awfully close but he was afraid of me i think
but here you are still a virgin you are virginal yet arent you
now now dont get exasperated i realize that youve always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men and i might add youve been wise heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage for men marriage is a matter of efficient logistics the male gets his food bed laundry tv pussy offspring and creature comforts all under one roof where he doesnt have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life which is what existence is all about but for a woman marriage is surrender
but countess
purely personal i believe you might enjoy one another
if you dont want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him
shit o dear thats enough to make me asthmatic the nerve of those twits what do they know about female odor dont interrupt heres my concept my ranch out west its a beauty ranch oh its got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes but its a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows mainly can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment my ranch is named the rubber rose after the rubber rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world so get this its on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence well these cranes stop off at my little pond siwash lake its called twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do ive never seen them understand but i hear theyre magnificent very big specimens i mean huge mothers and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads now whooping cranes in case you didnt know it are noted for their mating dance its just the wildest show in nature its probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground dears its overwhelming and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv right there on the home screen creations most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground in a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dancewalks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum and a can of dew offcamera a string quartet is playing debussy a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love are you starting to get it doesnt it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud my very goodness gracious grandiose lyrical erotic and girl scout oriented you cant top it ive hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios the best wildlife cinematographers around youre my eternal favorite princess grace herself couldnt be better not even if she had your personality which she doesnt anyway dear im out of photography now and into water colors ah how circuitous conversation is were back at the beginning the exact man ive wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings
i am once more about to make advertising history and only you the original yoni yumdew girl could possibly assist me
a job for me
sissy sissy blushing bride you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways the countess has arranged a job for you and what a job
oh my dear yes i bought a little ranch out west sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder a tax writeoff actually
your ranch
shes a young thing who works on my ranch real name is sally jones or something wooden like that shes cute as a hot fudge taco and of course it takes verve to change ones name so charmingly but she stinks like a slut just the same
what oh yes teehee jellybean
bonanza jellybean
you were the yoni yum girl from lets see from nineteen sixtyeight through nineteen seventy youve always smelled so nice like a little sister the irony has just killed me you the dew girl one of the few girls who doesnt need dew i loath the stink of females they are so sweet the way god made them then they start fooling around with men and soon theyre stinking like rotten mushrooms like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool like a tuna fishs retirement party they all stink from the queen of england to bonanza jellybean they stink
does that mean you might have an assignment for me

lets drop it
im not good enough for her to associate with am i im not good enough to even talk about her am i

well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden
theres nothing to tell
i wish youd tell me
because i dont want you to
why not
no
dont talk about elaine
dont talk about elaine
so old elaine robinson got started in a ford

im curious
benjamin what does it possibly matter
i mean did he take you up to his room with him did you go to a hotel
how do you think
well how did it happen
kind of
but i thought you i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then
art
art
because im interested mrs robinson now what was your major subject at college

what was your major
yes
at college

and you were a student also
was he a law student at the time
not particularly
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances
what
wait a minute wait a minute so how did it happen
all right now lets get to bed
well i never thought of you and mr robinson as the kind of people who
are you shocked
oh no you had to marry him because you got pregnant
dont tell elaine
i cant see why you did unless you didnt have to marry him or anything did you
think real hard benjamin
well i cant
see if you can guess
why did you do that
well wait a minute you married him
i never did benjamin now lets
what
no
well you loved him once i assume when you first knew him
i mean it doesnt sound like it could be much worse if you hated him at least youd hate him
is it
well thats kind of a bad situation then isnt it
i dont
well how do you feel about him then
no benjamin i dont hate him unhook my blouse
but you dont hate him
not exactly
wait a minute so you wouldnt say you loved him
weve talked enough benjamin
so you dont love him you wouldnt say you
is it
man is this interesting
on new years eve sometimes on his birthday
how many times a year
now and then he gets drunk a few times a year
you have not slept with your husband for five years
no
oh no are you kidding me
about five years
well how long has this been going on
no we dont
so you dont i mean i dont like to seem like im prying but i guess you dont sleep together or anything
we dont
now you say the driveways on your side of the house so i guess you dont sleep in the same room
thank you
right
can i undress and talk at the same time
now lets keep going here
calm down benjamin

what
were talking
the driveways on my side of the house
but what about the noise from the car what if

benjamin this isnt a very interesting topic
always
hes asleep
what do you say to him

theres no risk
there isnt any
i mean everything i dont know anything about how you how you work this i dont know how you get out of the house at night i dont know the risk involved
him
your husband mrs robinson theres something we could have a conversation about

do you want to hear it or not
i got up
yes i do
do you really want me to
no think of another topic tell me what you did today
can i take off my clothes now

are you tired of it
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together
well i just dont think we have much to say to each other
good i mean are we dead or something
if you want
now do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time

braddock braddock
id like you to know my sister miss dewitte
no actually im not
we havent
when did you two talk this over
about an hour ago
well when did you decide all this
no they dont
they dont know
oh ben this is so exciting
im going up to berkeley today
then ill simply invite all the robinsons over for dinner on thursday
i do
dont go on like this now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out
next time he suggests it ill tell him i have no intention of ever calling her up in my life
its pretty embarrassing i really dont know what to tell mr robinson its awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine
goodnight
but i want you to please please will you believe me
you dont
no
you believe me dont you
goodnight benjamin
im not but im im not very proud of what i do i usually get kind of drunk i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk then i take a hotel room so i wont have to drive home on the freeway i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after
but i dont want you to make up something
i do
not if you dont want to
oh well i dont shall i tell you what i do
because i know you dont drive around for twelve hours
well why do you why do you think that
well wait
benjamin im not going to pry into your affairs but id rather you didnt say anything at all than be dishonest goodnight benjamin
i dont meet anyone mother but why did you say that
no wait wait
well this is your business benjamin if you
why did you say that
meet someone
then what do you do do you meet someone
oh no
well you dont drive around from midnight until noon the next day benjamin
nothing else
what else
i drive around
no i do i want to tell you
you dont have to tell me if you dont want
when i go off
well im going to ask you what you do when you go off at night
what
benjamin im going to ask you something but you dont have to tell me if you dont want
sure
can i talk to you a minute
hello mrs robinson
say hello to mrs robinson benjamin
no its not its completely baked its a decision ive made
ben this whole idea sounds pretty halfbaked
no actually she doesnt know about us getting married yet
she doesnt know that youre coming up to berkeley
no she doesnt know about it
wait a minute you talked to elaine this morning
no i think youll want to wait on that
come on lets call the robinsons weve got something to celebrate
im going to marry elaine robinson
say that again
i guess ill just tell mr robinson that youre just too busy every evening doing god knows what
that has nothing to do with it
how do you know you havent seen her since high school i guess your evenings whatever you do with them are just too valuable
look elaine robinson and i do not get along
i guess shes not good enough for you is that it
now listen ben i think its a very good thing that a young man after hes done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself and lie around and drink beer and so on but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass
you got me
would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for what was the point of all that hard work
no
have you thought about graduate school
well its very comfortable just to drift here
why
different
to be what
i dont know i want it to be
what about it
i guess about my future
about what
well
worried
im just
i think ive talked about this enough i dont know how far i can go ben i dont know if i can prosecute or not but i think maybe i can in the light of whats happened i think maybe i can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again i have seen elaine and i have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure
huh
well im sure you think you do ben but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure youd get over that as quickly as you

flix and how do you live what kind of a person are you
i am felix benvenuto von gaigern my mother called me flix
oh i was ambitious then ambition was in my blood no rest no stopping we were drilled like little soldiers we danced in the school of the imperial ballet in st petersburg i was little and slim but hard as diamond a duty machine no rest no stopping and then i became famous and whoever is famous is alone but why should i be telling you this last night i did not know you at all who are you really i do not even know your name
that is not the truth you do not want to be alone youre afraid of being alone i know youre afraid i know you you were desperate just now if i go away youll be more desperate than ever say i am to stay with you say it
i want to be alone
the veronal you im going to stay here with you
what
im not going you know that im not going do you think i could leave you alone here after that
beautiful but so sad i did not know it was so dangerous to look into a womans bedroom
no
you are beautiful
what can you see
because i can see something in the mirror that you cannot my dear
why do you smile
i should like to smoke
i see you do only what you take pleasure in doing you take pleasure in coming into a womans bedroom and you come you take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony so you do it and what is your pleasure now
i oh no i do only what i take pleasure in doing
the stage frays ones nerves the discipline its so exacting discipline means doing what you dont want to do and take no pleasure in doing do you know what i mean have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline
just for a minute then
no you dont want to be alone at all you were in despair before if i left you youd feel worse than you did before you must not be alone you mustnt cry you must forget tell me that i can stay with you tell me
i want to be alone
that is not so you dont want to be alone
i want to be alone
im not going you know im not going let me stay here
i think you must go now the key is on the floor

grusinskaya oh oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya for the success of grusinskaya for the triumph of grusinskaya and what is she now just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases are you listening to me do you understand i want you to understand
i saw you just now then i saw you cry and now i see you in the mirror grusinskaya
you could love me it is so long since i have heard that word nobody has loved me for a long time it is so icycold to be famous one is so cruelly alone how is it that you let me look at you your hands your eyes why could you love me
a man who could love that is all who has forgotten everything else for you
go away who are you
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a womans room when shes alone
he disappeared later he was found dead
and
not quite strange now it is as if i had been expecting you you know once when the grand duke was alive i found a man hiding in my room a young officer
am i quite strange to you
strange man
you mustnt talk russian to me
alone all alone oh you strange strange creature
so alone
yes tired
how tired you are
and and
no irony youre so appealing so soft so tired i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever
and then
i did not know you were so beautiful and
why do you look at me like that

id like to smoke a cigarette
so you feel like coming into a ladys room and you come what now
im afraid not i usually do just what i feel like doing at the moment
nerves just nerves you must forgive me i have had a bad evening i am very tired do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine existence
dont cry it tears my heart to see you sob like that
i was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said that no i am not afraid it is strange
poor little grusinskaya does it do you good to cry are you afraid shall i go
because you love me you love me

yes mr preysing thats what we want to know
what we want to know about is manchester
very simple ive always liked the way you dressed preysing english isnt it
oh ho you want legal aid against us the whole thing seems to me to be very simple
shhh here he is now
if the preysing people get the manchester contract we shall certainly merge with the preysing company but if they havent theyre ruined preysing will have to declare himself
exactly
and ask me what its costing us to hammer it down
next week
see you soon preysing next week well meet and discuss further details
under these circumstances we might refuse to sign
under these circumstances its quite a different matter
i thought wed suspended negotiations gentlemen
preysing youre joking with us
gentlemen i am now free to announce that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated
if you actually have news from manchester then
oh no no the session is over lets go its off thank you gentlemen
what
why talk its over its over its finished youve broken off negotiations you did it youre calling them off you had nothing on your mind all day but manchester manchester manchester you dont suppose for one moment that im such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester
goodbye preysing i hope you pull through this is a very bad time to be in such a crisis weve
yes
then its all over
yes
youve decided against the merger
sorry preysing
what
mop rags mop rags were interested in something quite different
evil days ive shown you here my company exports to the balkans alone sixtyfive thousand marks worth of mop rags a year
and i said we didnt
i know you did i said you did
of course you took the initiative
scratched we did not take the initiative
tentative my foot a month before this your old fatherinlaw came very privately and scratched at my door
we did not approach you
oh now lets talk like adults you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldnt sound so good when you first approached us
now to proceed with the projected merger the advantages for the saxonia are so obvious
all you have to do is phone for it
no water what a place

which i hope will make you very happy
for you
oh harold
its all right its organic
oh youve thought of everything and champagne
supper for two
oh harold you are so young
youve never cried before i never thought you would i thought despite anything you could always be happy
i was remembering how much this meant to me it was after the war i had nothing except my life how different i was then and yet how the same
you havent changed a bit ill put it in my wallet
harold that picture is almost twentyfive years old
it looks like you thanks
ill never forget you maude but i would like a photo of you
they mocked me they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings but sharp photographs so i tossed them out my memory fades i know but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling and not by kodak with silver nitrate
why
i took them out
why are there no photographs in these frames
here
yes
maude
end where i began
oh no but i should have liked to have been an astronaut a private astronaut able to just go out and explore like the men who sailed with magellan i want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world what a joke it will be if like them i
you should have been a poet
we uareu alone you and me and everybody but we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in china is looking at them too someone we dont know and most likely will never see that someone is breathing along with us and the star gazers of the past from peasant to princes and the stargazers of the future all of us breathing and looking up there we are alone but look at the stars and never feel lonely
science thinks there isnt that we are all alone in the universe
i dont know perhaps
do you think there is any life up there
yes theyre old friends
look at the stars
well theyre my species
you sure have a way with people
right on it wouldnt be a celebration without it

that wasnt very scary
she took my head
give me that im going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs
just like this
of you youll all end up like this
dont you advance on me
traitor benedict arnold remember nathan hale right sir
dont you talk to me like that you little foul mouth degenerate really sir i thought that you at least
what with your skill and my experience i think we can come up with something
maude do you think you can help me
theyd put you in jail eh well historically youd be in very good company thats what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo would you like to do a little raking work im told done with no selfish interest purifies the mind you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self on the other hand senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided
really just put it there harold
but theyll put me in jail
well dont go
but they have
but they cant do that you havent even got the vote
theyre going to draft me in the army im going to be sent away
what is it harold

ive never met her my mother set it up

its sinking harold going over the horizon where we are all going to go its getting dark let each man hold on to his candle and get a light whereer he can
yodeling

with life
with god
pray no i communicate
maude do you pray
spreckled with uncountable stars the stars are shining right now we just cant see them just another instance of all thats going on that is beyond human perception

well its a question of timing and the right equipment and plenty of patience you really want to hear about this
how ingenious tell me about them
died seventeen times not counting maiming shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood
what was that
yes i havent lived ive died a few times
me when i look around me i know i know nothing i remember though once long ago in persia we met a wise man in the bazaar he was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay his specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin the wisest he said the truest the most instructive words for all men at all times frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel i peered through a magnifying glass to read the words and this too shall pass away well the wise man was right if you remember that you cant help but live life fully
you are the wisest person i know
well they say he was very wise so im sure he must have
did confucius say that
vice virtue its best not to be too moral you cheat yourself out of too much life aim above morality as confucius says dont simply be good make good things happen
im sure picking up on vices
its all right its organic
well i really dont smoke

what were you fighting for
my umbrella oh thats just a relic i found it when i was packing to come to america it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition a long time ago
whats that
thank you

thank you
oh its all right its organic

still i think youd upset people and im not sure thats right
what owners harold we dont uownu anything its a transitory world we come on the earth with nothing and we go out with nothing so isnt ownership a little absurd

and you get into any car you want and just drive off

mother
well i want you to go to bed directly after dinner you know how susceptible you are to colds harold has always been a delicate child even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness harold dear eat up your beets
i have a sore throat
of course harolds father had a similar sense of the absurd i remember once in paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next i hear hes arrested for floating nude down the seine experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings well that cost quite a little bit of enfluence and dargent to hush up i can tell you harold dear stop playing with your food dont you feel well
no like this
like a tea ceremony
an ancient japanese ceremony
ohhh whats harikari
this one is particularly interesting its a harikari blade
oh hes in the army i do so like the military dont you those uniforms make men look so virile i did what price glory in summer stock i played charmaine with a french accent
no my uncle
oh is this your father
oh i studied the guitar i had to give it up gave me calluses on my fingers as an actress i cant afford to have a tarnished instrument
no im learning the banjo do you
do you play
well actually it was the name of my drama teacher louis sunshine perhaps youve heard of him he was such an influence on the development of my instrument that means my body in theatre talk well when i came to hollywood i felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form so i took on sunshine dore is my real name well dore actually my what a lovely place you have here
is sunshine your real name
no thank you they stain my fingers
would you like a cigarette
cant complain
how do you do
what kind of stuff
id show him my hearse and my room and stuff
what would you say
id have liked to talk to him

no id have liked to
i see tell me harold do you remember your father at all
very well now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies how do you feel about that
yes
we are not relating today harold i sense a definite resistance a lack of true and helpful communication i find you a very interesting case harold but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psychoanalytical process and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment do you understand
i burnt down the chemistry building
then why did you leave
yes
your studies
yes
your classmates
yes
you liked your teachers
yes
i see were you happy at school harold
no
is this a friend you had when you were away at school
no
would you care to talk about this friend
well maybe one
none at all
no
you dont seem to be listening i asked do you have any friends
huh
harold
i go to funerals
thats very interesting harold and i think very illuminative there seems to be a definite pattern emerging your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state your selfdestructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction what do you think and of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution but tell me what do you do for ufunu what activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others what do you find fulfilling what gives you that certain satisfaction
what else do you like
no its the junk i like to look at junk
is it the machines the noise the people
i dont know
i see junkyards what is the fascination there
yes what kind of things do you do
you mean when im not working on a
oh well how do you spend your day
my mother spoke to my uncle victor hes in the army and he fixed it up
what about the draft
no
im sure but what else do you do with your time do you go to school
and a lot of time
ah yes
i put a lot of effort into these things
why
yes it does
does that worry you
i dont think im getting through to mother like i used to
no i suppose not how do you feel about your mother
i wouldnt say benefit
and were they all done for your mothers benefit
a rough estimate
fifteen
well a rough estimate id say fifteen
just give me a rough estimate
well some worked out better than others some had to be abandoned in the planning stages do you include the first time then theres the question of maiming
and why is that
an accurate number would be difficult to gauge
tell me harold how many of these eh suicides have you performed
she took my head
stay where you are harold
shes a commie pig were going to nail every last one
harold calm down this is
crazy parasite commie bastard get out of here
harold
parasite
harold thats udisgustingu
boy to think i could maybe make my own
whats the chance of getting one of these
harold
of your kill ears nose scalp privates
souvenirs
sir how about souvenirs
harold i think youre getting carried away here
id like that you could see the blood squirt out
well i dont
how about to slit his throat
eh
to strangle someone choke him squeeze out his life between your hands
yes
how about handtohand combat
oh sure
and to use the bayonet pachoie
oh sure a variety of weapons
will they really teach me to shoot
zat
yes
another mans life in your sights
the moment of truth
to kill the taste of blood in your mouth
thats right
to pit your own life against another
its the greatest excitement in the world
i hope so sir golly i never knew it could be so exciting
sure be able to tell your children something for them to look up to be proud of
you think so sir
well youll soon have stories like that to tell of your own
jeez thats a great story
they came at me from all sides hundreds of em we kept firing zattattattat throw the grenades i shouted mac throw the grenades hes dead joe said and kept right on feeding me bullets zattattattat they kept falling but they kept coming bullets whizzing all around me zot joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head i thought i was done for but i kept firing zattattat only one thought kept me going kill kill for mac and joe and the rest of the guys kill a blinding flash i wake up on a stretcher did we hold i asked the medic yes sir he said and i slipped into unconsciousness
jeez sir thats pretty strong stuff
and so i ask you why the hell did we give up on the germans those damn politicians in washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace hell look at history the two best wars this country has fought were against the jerries now i say get the krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong and lets get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support
war is not all black
is that a fact well that fits in right along with everything ive been saying war is not all black
during wartime the national suicide rate goes down
lets examine the facts on it i say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war i say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy hell world war ii gave us the ballpoint pen thats common knowledge
perfectly lovely you know this is what were defending everything thats good and beautiful in the american way of life oh theres some nut peace petitioner over there lets go off this way those crazy commie bastards i dont know why we tolerate em parasites
yes sir
call me sir harold first thing you learn in the army an officer deserves your respect

would you would you get the impression that i wanted to see it
i havent seen evil dead ii yet yeah yeah i hear you
just listen to me if i said to you
im sorry rob but im struggling here i dont understand any part of this conversation youre asking me what i would think if you told me that you hadnt seen a film that youve seen what am i supposed to say
no but would you think from that one sentence that i was going to see it
id think you were a cinematic idiot and id feel sorry for you
yeah yeah i know but say i hadnt seen it and i said to you i havent seen evil dead ii yet what would you think
to me it would mean that youre a liar you saw it twice once with laura oops once with me and dick we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo offscreen in the fourteenth century
just come on what would it mean to you that sentence i havent seen evil dead ii yet
barry if i were to say to you i havent seen evil dead ii yet what would that mean
youre like a little squirrel of music storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music musical lint old shit shit shit
theres something different about the sound of her voice and what did she mean last night she hasnt slept with him yet yet what does yet mean anyway i havent seen evil dead ii yet what does that mean it means youre going to go doesnt it
ooh a kind of recent record robs sly declaration of new classicstatus slipped into a list of old classics nice lets get it on couldnt you make it more obvious than that
shut up lets get it on marvin gaye from lets get it on airbag radiohead from ok computer
oh no rob thats not obvious enough not at all dick did you hear that
thunder road bruce springsteen from born to run smells like teen spirit nirvana nevermind
ehh
okay top five side one track ones number one janie jones the clash from the clash
what am i missing what do you have to be happy about
im not snickering im smiling because im happy
what are you snickering about
what do you mean what
what
its not my car now is it its lauras car and thus laura has it so its an assbumping double transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab wow fucking great
we can take your car
thats fucking great barry we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each fantastic barry
were only on the fucking list for maries gig at the pulaski pub thats all all three of us
i didnt know it was classified information i mean i know we dont have any customers but i thought that was a bad thing not like a business strategy
what did you tell her about the shop for
maybe a picture of me in the liner notes
i wanna live with a musician shed write songs at home ask me what she thought of them maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes
i wanna date a musician
but now i kind of like it
yeah
oh now youre defending that motherfucker youre going soft in your old age rob there was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street now all of a sudden im offending your golf buddy youre right rob i am so sorry how are we ever going to make enough money to get you and laura into the country club
it wasnt even his terrible taste it was his daughters
he offended me with his terrible taste
what did he ever do to you
bullshit the guy was going to buy one record which we didnt even have and leave and never come back again anyway why not have a little fun big fucking deal
barry im fucking broke i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didnt like but its gotta stop
our customers you think that mr ll bean out there is going to be a regular
i dont want you talking to our customers like that again
oh so whats the point then
not the point
we didnt even really have it i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is dont drive drunk i was just goofing on the straight and it never cost you a penny
you just drove a fucking customer away barry
rob top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the s and s subquestion is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins is it better to burn out than to fade away
nice barry
well whats the point in that
well do it next monday
great thats the fun of working in a record store playing crappy pap you dont want to listen to i thought this tape was going to be you know a conversation stimulator i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that and you just had to ruin it
since you brought that bullshit tape in
since when did this shop become a fascist regime
how can it be bullshit to state a preference
little latin lupe lu
say it
play it
whats next
dont you want to hear whats next
yeah well its fucking monday afternoon you should get out of bed earlier

they always seemed what they always seemed really great is what they always seemed they picked up where your precious echo left off and youre sitting here complaining about no more echo albums i cant believe that you dont own that record thats insane
they always seemed
oh really well what about the first jesus and mary chain
i have all of the others
its almost impossible to find especially on cd yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables but every other echo and the bunnymen album
do you even know your daughter there is no way she likes that song or is she in a coma
whats your problem what did i why are you
because its sentimental tacky crap thats why not do we look like the kind of store that sells i just called to say i loved you go to the mall and stop wasting our time
why not
no you cant

no not nothing whats wrong with the righteous brothers
nothing
what
oh well nevermind
no the righteous brothers
mitch ryder and the detroit wheels
its the new
holy shiite what the fucks this
just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary thats all
what are you talking about
the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite do you have an appointment
wheres rob
oh hi
hey barry
no no mom wants you to come to the funeral its on friday
somebodys gonna die by blitz bella lugosis dead bauhaus its got that creepy halloween feeling
haha right its no problem i love making tapes
would you really wow i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home
oh well the kinky wizards are you know what why dont i just make you a tape
and the new label and the kinky wizards
oh you know a lot of people arent too old for clubs but theyre too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and theres nowhere for them
okay dance music for old people
look im sorry about this but id like the upsetter by lee scratch perry in there instead of sin city
music for old people what does that mean
who oh my friend my friend is laura a girl a friend whos a girl
whats his name
yeah
nice friend
well it was a friends idea really and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it so i should really put a james brown in there
thats five so why did you decide to deejay again
sure but is that it for the list
well i wouldnt mind a quick chat if you got the time
is that it
fine thats great
oh im sure i can manage something sin city new rose by the damned hit it and quit it by funkadelic shipbuilding elvis costello japanese import no horns or different horns anyway um mystery train by elvis presley and spaced cowboy by sly and the family stone a bit controversial i know but
look if you cant think of anything it doesnt matter ill do one my five favorite from the old days at the dodger
can i go home and work this out and let you know in a week or so
well if one of them is this sin city thing
what do you mean four more
nevermind any five so four more
of course well yeah a bit sin city by the flying burrito brothers is an alltime top five but i wouldnt play it at the club its a countryrock ballad everybodyd go home
is there a difference
oh boy in the club or at home
your desert island topfive
pardon me
yeah well lets see what are youre alltime top five records
yeah i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it
right so you must have an enormous record collection
so is now a good time
what i mean is i didnt mean you look young you dont you dont look old either you look just as old as you are a bit younger maybe but not a lot not much just right
huh you used to come to the club i shouldnt have let you in you must have only been about sixteen
i thought i would ask you a few questions if thats okay
oh okay
well i used to go to the dodger on your nights and i saw youre doing it again and that your putting out a record and its sort of a thenand now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now
right why
im caroline fortis from the reader i want to do a story on you
uh thats me
im looking for deejay rob gordon
may i help you
oh god no i didnt want to hurt his feelings
did you tell that to marco when he did his whatdoesitallmean thing with you
its all kind of lost in the in the dense mists of time now it wasnt that i really liked marco more in fact i thought you were more shall we say attractive than him it was just that he knew he was goodlooking and you didnt and that made a difference somehow you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you and that got kind of beat if you know what i mean your selfimage started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful you made me laugh and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved and marco seemed a bit more i dont know glamorous more sure of himself less hard work because i felt like i was dragging you around sort of a little sunnier sparkier i dont know you know what people are like at that age they make very superficial judgements do you think thats superficial he was a clown if its any consolation
cmon just answer the question you can say what you like what the hell
theres been a rash of them recently i find it a little unnerving in fact marco called a few months back and he wanted to see me and rehash the past as they say and i wasnt really up for it do all men go through this
huh
fuck i knew it youre going through one of those whatdoesit allmean things
why did you break up with me for marco

we wont leave it ian not ever
good so shall we leave it at that then
ive already left it you pathetic rebound fuck now get your patchouli stink out of my store
good so shall we leave it at that then
think about it rob
i dunno
good so shall we leave it at that then
yeah
weve noticed and were glad but you know how are we going to make peace here we want to make things easier for you what can we do obviously i know how special laura is and i know things cant be good for you at the moment id hate it if i lost her but id like to think that if she decided she didnt want to see me anymore id respect that decision do you see what im saying
yeah well ive stopped all that now
we are not talking jokey understatement here rob were talking actionable harassment ten phone calls a night hanging around outside my house
funnily enough i havent been too thrilled about it
come on rob my relationship with laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal
what needs sorting out
hello rob remember me im ray ian
can i help you
its gonna be fine these people are ready for anything
im an idiot i should have played the record first this place is about to get burned down
well youve asked
i dunno didnt think about it really it was the asking that was the important thing
i mean maybe youre right but were you really expecting me to say yes
shut up im only trying to explain
ive changed my mind thats the most romantic thing ive ever heard i do i will
this stuff love and marriage i want to think about something else
about what
im just sick of thinking about it all the time
so
fair enough
no i dont think so im just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days fair enough
are you persuadable
very persuasive
i dont know
dont sulk what brought all this on
right okay then shall we go
no probably not
would you marry me if i was
well forgive me if i dont think of you as the worlds safest bet
not in love exactly but
im sorry but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader werent you
oh well thanks a fucking bunch
i know
i mean it
ha ha ha hoo hoo hoo
im going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not to me
what are you going to talk to me about
right
im going to talk to you
are you going to talk to me or shall i get my paper out
not really
are you worried about tomorrow night
i know i dont get it
thats okay you seem pissed off all the time though
im sorry ive been acting like a jerk i do appreciate what youve done for me and i know youve done it for the best possible reasons and i do love you even though i act like i dont
we took care of that
its no joke im responsible for what happens you know embarrassment aside theres a lot of money and effort in this at least by my standards i have to put down a deposit for the room i have to pay the pressing plant for the records sleeve them sticker them
theyll go on early nobody will even be there yet and i told them they cant play for more than a half hour
yeah his band is playing a set
barry barry knows about this
barry said its done
thats not the point i mean what if the single isnt done in time
what do you ever do that cant be cancelled
you had no right supposing i was doing something that couldnt be cancelled
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we werent together anymore it might even be why i came back
and the triumphant return of dj rob gordon triumphant return
just local of course
what
yeah and he said its a good way to break out a record especially for what he said and i quote would be a highly anticipated event locally he helped me put out a press release
has drag city records i know i know you told dan koretzky about this
i called dan koretzky because he
i tricked you into meeting some people youd think were great i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way
you did that deliberately you knew all along id like them it was a trick
ha
i know but youve never met it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him
oh well we dont really get along paul and i
at paul and mirandas paul from work
where
wanna go to dinner
nothing
hi what are you doing
hi
no use
all im saying is you have to allow for things to happen to people most of all to yourself otherwise whats the use
how what would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice
youre being stupid
yeah youre alright but youre certainly not happy so what happens if you get happy and yes i know thats the title of an elvis costello album i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention should we split up because im used to you being miserable what happens if you i dont know start youre own record label and its a success time for a new girlfriend
im alright
less neurotic are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life
harder
more confident maybe
youre tougher
i cant go to work with my hair dyed pink and i can afford to go shopping more now and ive met a couple people i like over the last year or so
and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and
you havent changed so much as a pair of socks in the years ive known you if weve grown apart then im the one whos done the growing and all ive done is change jobs
but why doesnt it matter that were not the same people we used to be
but what
no but
because im not allowed to i still do after work so what should we just break up is that what youre saying because if you are im going to run out of patience
well you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger you wore jeans and tshirts and so did i and i still do and you dont
how how were we the same people
but it wasnt supposed to be like this when i met you we were the same people and now were not and
money does not matter i do not care how much you earn id just like you to be a little happier in your work but beyond that you can do what you like
fantastic the girlfriend lottery
ill pay for you even though you owe me money we have to do something with the money i earn i need to i deserve it you can just think of it as winning the lottery
hey great idea what ill do is tomorrow ill get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley s on the sub label and ill pay for it that way
like mexico or jamaica or new york even
okay
look rob if great sex was as important as you think it is and if i was having great sex with him then we wouldnt be lying here now and that is my last word on the subject okay
oh great
to make you feel better
well why the fuck would you want to lie anyway
well i was gonna lie and now i cant because youd know i was lying
oh cmon laura just say something lie if you want itd stop me asking you questions and itd make me feel better
okay thats cool okay but the nice time we just had was it nicer as nice or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago
look were okay now we just had a nice time lets leave it at that
you know the difference
whats the difference
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex
it was like sex what else could it be like
what it was like
want to know what exactly
cmon i want to know
okay
lets go home okay
i know its not very romantic but there will be romance again at some stage im sure i just i need you rob thats it and we know each other and we care for each other and youve made it clear that you want me back so
mission accomplished
rays a disaster i dont know what that was all about except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade i guess and blow it all apart
what about ian
everythings too hard maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own but not now i dont
so if you had a bit more energy wed stay split but things being how they are what with you wiped out youd like us to get back together
im too tired not to go out with you
laura
i lived with you you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now youre worried i might kill you and youre entitled to worry isnt that a terrible thing isnt that sad
look we can do other things
i didnt mean that i mean was that all you used
yes of course theres nothing to worry about
no no its not are you still on the pill
oh rob were not going to go through that again
you know with ray
i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today
hi
hello it doesnt seem so long ago that i looked at you from here
itll have to be sex then
ive only got a couple left im saving them for later
i want to feel something else than this its either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm
what
i dont know sometime later listen rob would you have sex with me
when are you going back
cmon
what do you want to do
i dont want to go back
sure i understand look i dont want to take up any more of your time you get back and ill wait here for a bus
i didnt mess things up because i was scared i slept with ray because i was sick of you and i needed something to snap me out of it
what do you mean
thank you i appreciate it i cant reciprocate
i can see why you say that look im sorry i really am the last thing i wanted was thats why i left because i lost it and i didnt want to blow my top in there and look the reason i fucked everything up was because i was scared i just wanted you to know thats all
youre also an idiot
mmnn
youre soaking
uh no
are you going to lie in that flower bed all night
sure ill see you on friday
lizll give you a lift she knows where to go and everything i dont have time to talk rob ive got too much to do
yes of course
look are you coming or not
i dont care as long as you dont expect me to hold your hand
do you want me to be there
my dad liked you and mom never told him wed split because he wasnt up to it and oh i dont know i dont really understand it i think she thinks hell be able to see whats going on its like hes been through so much what with dying and everything that she doesnt want to upset him any more than she has to

guess who i just saw right by my store ian in starbucks neat huh
hey how ya doin
hello
well think about it
i guess i am
youre being deliberately obtuse
i got it you like sting but you dont like gram parsons because youve never heard of him
im sorry to go on about it but i dont know theres a lesson here somewhere and i want to make sure you get it
okay okay i get the picture
theyre not really though are they i know you bought them for me and that was really sweet of you but that was when you were trying to turn me into you i cant take them i know theyd just sit around staring at me and id feel embarrassed by them and they dont fit in with the rest of whats mine do you understand that sting record you bought for me that was a present for me i like sting and you hate him but the rest of this stuff who the hell is nick lowe or gram parsons or the boredoms i dont know these people i
sure they are
those arent mine
dont forget your cds
oh ho so very infrequently
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it
mmm hmm
you know im a good person
you make me laugh much more than ray does if thats what youre getting at but i already knew you could make me laugh its everything else i dont know about
this is where youre supposed to say that you havent laughed this much in ages and then you see the error of your ways
i hate him too so i just call him mavis or sissyboy or mavis the sissyboy
ray i hate ian
im sorry but can we get this straight what is his fucking name ian or ray what do you call him
you know i didnt mind and its not as if rays place is any better
ill bet you cant remember what you were doing here can you i mean how much are you making now sixty seventy and you were living in this shitty place
fix it up itll make you feel better
you know what i mean
that bad eh
i dont really want to talk about it to be honest
you still together going all right
im sure
it was kind of funny
hes at home listen i cant believe he went to the store im mortified actually im really sorry he had no right to do that and i told him so
those look heavy wheres ian
yep i might have missed some stuff im so used to some things being here that i dont even notice them
is that the last of it
i called and called but you were out i thought id be gone before you got back
no not really i mean i think about it but no i dont really think about it
you dont ever think about other people
i dont want to dont need to i love you
im not experimenting why dont you go experiment
think about what i said i mean if you want to experiment or whatever
jesus i do not know ill talk to you later
are you still in love with me
im not hold on
i think the big question here is where are you if you dont mind my saying so and i think i know where you are youre running on the run youre running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship and youre just going to hit it again with ian but its going to be with a world music bunny rabbitlooking earthshoewearing doctor whowatching twit who doesnt really understand you not the way that i do and will more in the future and youll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that youre in now only later and with him
i figured it was where are you
its me
hello
you do huh
call me at work we can arrange to meet properly i dont want this to be the last conversation we have i know what youre like
i dont have your number
will you call me
look i gotta go i work too you know
we can meet for another drink if you want so i can explain it better i owe you that much
nothing
and anyway i keep trying to tell you thats not really the point is it the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess rob are you there what are you thinking
you must have known it would happen you couldnt have been entirely unprepared like you said ive been living with the guy we were bound to get around to it sometime
you kind of have to start with elvis costello but where motel matches i want you i hope youre happy now green shirt his records should be sealed in cases that say in case of vicious betrayal smash glass where did you sleep last night sure but by robert johnson or by nirvana maybe a liz phair track there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with some devils advocate stuff the silver jews could be good when youre ready to start putting it all behind you but i think were getting ahead of ourselves there ah dylan bob fucking dylan now bob dylan would the phone rings he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing
i want you to say that you havent and i want it to be the truth
oh rob what do you want me to say
i guess
is that why you wanted to see me

well the answer is that i dont know either we havent done it yet
i dont know
you really think it would make a difference either way
of course it is
jesus christ rob is that really whats bothering you
well sex i guess is sex with him better
is what better better than what
is it better
just ask it
you wont like it
nevermind
it sounds stupid
fine one
no problem if i can ask one question
im too tired for this now i know im asking a lot but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up i need to be able to think while i do it and i cant think while youre here
yeah great
okay okay we have a nine percent chance of getting back together does that clarify the situation
well if you could tell me roughly it would help
i dont fucking know what chance you fucking have
hey i just want to know where i stand what chance
oh rob shut up
so we have a chance of getting back together again
i suppose so
well if you dont know theres a chance right its like if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said i dont know if hes got a chance of survival or not then that doesnt mean the patients definitely going to die now does it it means he might live even if its only a remote possibility
i dont know
so what you havent definitely decide to dump me theres still a chance well get back together
look maybe youll grow up and well get it together you and me maybe ill never see either of you again i dont know all i know is that its not a good time to be living here
well then why dont you quit it while you seem to not be ahead
i am not living with him ive just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what im doing look this has nothing to do with anyone else you know that dont you i left because we werent exactly getting along and we werent talking about it and i suddenly realized that i like my job and i like what my life is could be turning into and that im getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i cant really see that ever happening with you and yeah yeah i sort of get interested in someone else and that went further than it should have so it seemed like a good time to go but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run probably nothing
why is that childish your living with the guy im just asking how its going
rob dont be childish
no so is it working out with ian
did you say something
what what
what
no
i guess its not that obvious then
i dont know
whats the obvious stuff
just the obvious stuff
what were the others
i dont know its one of the things i thought of
what gimme a fucking break is that what you think that your not big enough a deal for me jesus gimme a little credit rob
good so is it my job
im sorry i havent been very fair to you thats why i came here to the store this evening i feel terrible rob this is really hard you know
had to work it out for myself though didnt i
i think you know that
so where have you been staying for the last week

have you tackled the great reorganization yet
not really
and do you like it that way
yes look at me look at our the apartment what else do i have other than records and cds
you really believe that
but laura thats me thats all there is to me there isnt anything else if youve lost interest in that youve lost interest in everything
yeah sure more so then than i am now thats life though isnt it
so you werent interested in music at all
well i liked you you were a deejay and i thought you were hot and i didnt have a boyfriend and i wanted one
you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now when i first met you and i made you that tape you loved it you said and i quote it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection
i remember the song i just couldnt remember who sang it
but dont you remember
is that right id like a word with him
hey marvin gaye got to give it up thats our song marvin gaye is responsible for our entire relationship
and who says i like marvin gaye anyway
alright alright but
whatever and the israelis and the palestinians dont art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute and the israelis and the palestinians are art garfunkel and marvin gaye
made made marvin gaye is dead his father shot him in
its not like saying that at all actually rob art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records

only because its never the time i cant go on apologizing my whole life you know

but
and whats the matter with a thousand dollars

if anybody had told me id be sitting at lunch with him but he swept me right off my feet
he comes by it naturally his grandfather was a snake
oh hes not the man for you i can see that but i sort of like him got a lot of charm
youre so nice bruce you think everybody else is

i said uh i said even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you
i wont be more than ten minutes i promise you

oh this is all right bruce i just wanted to be sure
gee take a look will you
theres a lot of counterfeit big bills going around

oh bruce let me see that money hildy gave you
thats the kind of stuff they want
shes well shes very motherly thats about the best description i know
ill find her bruce if i have to put every detective in the city on the job tell you what go over to the missing persons bureau and describe your mother what does she look like
and now i dont know where my mother is she may be lost
ts ts ts

well bruce here you are certified and everything
no bruce you didnt come between us it was all over for her before you came on the scene for me itll never be over
gee you almost make me feel like a heel coming between you
and the beauty of it is shell never have to know till ive passed on maybe shell think kindly of me after im gone
im beginning to realize that
and remember this bruce i love her too
well of course if you put it that way
figure it this way i ought to be good for twentyfive years by that time youll probably have made enough so that the money wont mean anything but suppose you havent made good dont you think hildys entitled to a quiet old age without any worries
well im independent too
well youll take care of her after all if that doctors right im going to live for a long time yet look bruce this is a debt of honor i was a very bad husband hildy could have got a lot of alimony if shed wanted to but she wouldnt take any she had it coming to her but she was too independent
i feel i ought to take care of her
why shouldnt i make hildy my beneficiary ive got nobody else to leave it to
i dont know this makes me feel funny
you havent seen anything yet
i never knew hildy to be so determined before
we could take the six oclock train hildy if it would save a mans life
oh an hour for the interview another hour to write it
how long would the interview take
how
but couldnt you show the man wasnt responsible
all youve got to do is talk to him but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be reelected
are you sure williams is not all there
its simple a poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down
just what is the lowdown on williams
just sweeney again one of my best reporters
anything the matter
i see what you mean
well i honestly feel that way i figure im in one line of business that really helps people of course we dont help you much when youre alive but afterward thats what counts
i sometimes wish id taken out insurance but of course now it doesnt matter still i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do
i dont blame them
well albanys a mighty good insurance town most people there take it out pretty early in life
hows business bruce
yes i know hildy will you ever forget the night you brought the governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath she didnt even know i was in town
mighty nice little town albany theyve got the state capitol there you know
thatll be nice a home with mother a real honeymoon in albany too ow
just for the first year
i know you will bruce are you going to live with your mother
well ill try to give her one
i dont think shell need you very much i aim to do most of the protecting myself
i know i wasnt a good husband hildy but you can always count on me
oh your mother well of course that relieves my mind
no my mother

hartman if you take this desk out of this building ill put you behind bars
well just start by impounding the post property is that your desk
youll see nothing of the kind sheriff
ill show you what im doing burns youre guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning post im going to see that the post is fined ten thousand dollars for this
whos under arrest you pimpleheaded squaretoed spy do you realize what youre doing
no well johnson youre under arrest you too burns
ill give you three minutes to tell me where he is
youre barking up the wrong tree hartman
oh you did well thats very very interesting this happens to be the gun that earl williams shot his way out with
i can explain that hartman when hildy told me she wanted to interview earl williams i thought it might be dangerous and i gave her a gun to defend herself
close that door dont let anybody in or out
get out
youll ask me to what
if youve any accusations to make hartman make them in the proper manner otherwise ill have to ask you to get out
you cant bluff me burns i dont care who you are or what paper youre editor of
who do you think you are breaking in here like this
what did you say your name was pinkus
save that for the tribune
hes insane or drunk or something why if this unfortunate man williams has really been reprieved i personally am tickled to death arent you pete
out of the mouths of babes
thats absurd on the face of it mr burns hes talking like a child
the power of the press huh
this is the morning post youre talking to
all the lawyers in the world arent going to help you
duffy get liebowitz
your lucks not with you now
does it you forget the power that always watches over the morning post
you you
but hildy i can explain
sure heaven youve probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in to get a new story for your paper
itll be heaven
yes hildy darling im just a fool thats what i am i know what its going to be like
hildy darling
sure i can look at the policy i gave him with this ring i thee wed and with all my worldly goods i thee endow and thereto i plight thee my troth
walter you cant do that
how about bruces
youre not fooling anybody
hildy from this time on no tricks no doublecrossing everything on the level
thats what he said the last time dont believe him judge
now dont argue hildy how about it judge
what
i dont want to rush you take a couple of seconds
well id like to be ladylike and think it over
whats the good of arguing about something that probably doesnt exist look hildy im proposing to you what do you say
whats the matter with my brains
well if she looked like you say my brains and your looks that mightnt be such a bad combination
what would you do if it was a daughter
sure i cant last forever i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper
walter
sure i do and ill tell you something else id like a baby
niagara falls walter you dont mean that
hildy if thats what you want all right well even go to how about niagara falls
well maybe id like to know just once
thats what makes it romantic every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is and vice versa but us you never know where i am and im not sure where you are thats romance
a fine honeymoon with a murderer right in the boudoir and that other honeymoon in a coal mine
sure it was good it was wonderful only you expected it to be like other marriages it cant be like other marriages were different were a different world look at what we went through today i wouldnt trade that for any honeymoon in the world i bet you wouldnt either
thanks walter but its no good we tried it
both jobs are open hildy the paper and being mrs walter burns
its awfully clear now bruce needs a wife who can give him a home and affection and peace i couldnt do that for him walter im what you made me a cheap reporter whod give up her soul for a story is that job still open
sure
on the nine oclock train thats the one he took isnt it
whered you wire him
no he wont i wired him that i wasnt coming
what do you mean brucell be waiting for you in albany
yeah only only im not leaving walter
and what a way to quit while youre still champion thats the way to leave hildy
thanks
the greatest yarn ever written by anybody my hats off to you hildy
because im a newspaper woman heaven help me
then why are you doing it
dont touch me im not doing it for you
hildy
whats the difference im going to write that story and you know it
well what is it
all right heads i go tails i stay to write the story ready
flip a coin
i dont know what to do walter
hes going to have you the rest of his life hildy cant you give me another hour
yeah i suppose i could but walter
suit yourself kid this isnt for me to decide of course you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning
well if its my last story id like it to be a good one but i guess i cant walter
bruce is making the nine oclock train i told him youd be on it unless you want to write this story yourself
thats all right walter its as much my fault as yours
sorry hildy i didnt mean to be making love to another mans fiancee
dont remind me thats how we happened to
in the shoreland hotel and our only chaperon was the poor old ladys stomach
we sure did but we had to go in hiding for a week
yeah but that time we stole old lady haggertys stomach off the coroners physician we proved she was poisoned though didnt we
yeah what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory six scoop interviews
remember the time we broke into the das office and copied fifi randells diary
weve certainly been in some swell jams
i mean working together just like the old days the things weve been through hildy
in a way
uhuh as long as we were in there together pitching they couldnt lick us well its been a lot of fun
worried i was petrified werent you
dont tell me you were worried
how was that for a tight squeeze
and your arrest youll each get about ten years i think
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment
which ought to be about three hours more id say
who did you talk to
when did you deliver this first
hanging an innocent man to win an election
murder uh
wait a minute let go there
yes what are you afraid of hildy i dare him to move that desk out of here
no
what is it here
no you dont walter
who says so im going to the morgue to look

i get it
well think it then because its true well crucify that mob were going to keep williams under cover till morning so the post can break the story exclusive then well let the governor in on the capture share the glory with him
id like to think
dont get technical at a time like this do you realize what youve done youve taken a city thats been graftridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn youre kicking em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new yorks having under la guardia well make such monkeys out of these wardheelers next tuesday that nobodyll vote for them not even their wives
wait a minute wasnt it stanley who discovered livingstone
you know youve got the brain of a pancake that wasnt just a story you covered it was a revolution hildy this is the greatest yarn in journalism since livingstone discovered stanley for the new york herald
i know but
you drooling idiot what do you mean youre getting out there are three hundred and sixtyfive days in the year one can get married but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk once in a lifetime hildy youve got the whole city by the seat of the pants
oh get off that trapeze theres your story smear it all over the front page earl williams caught by the morning post and take all the credit i covered your story for you and i got myself in a fine mess doing it and now im getting out i know i told you that twice before today but this time i mean it
get bruce out of jail how can you worry about a man whos resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on hildy this is war you cant desert now
let go o me ive got to get bruce out of jail oh walter why did you have to do this to me
where do you think youre going
i know where is he i said
she jumped out of the window
yes where is he
walter ddid you see that
hold on a minute
it better be fifteen minutes because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meters clicking away to beat the band
thats great work hildy huh oh will you stop worrying about the money ill see you get it in fifteen minutes
no this is on the level walter im not good enough to make this one up the sheriff gave his gun to the professor the professor gave it to earl and earl gave it right back to the professor right in the stomach who no egelhoffer wasnt hurt badly they took him to the county hospital where theyre afraid hell recover
no kidding hildy say this isnt a rib
well im coming to it it seems the professor had to have a gun to re enact the crime with and who do you suppose supplied it nobody else but that great thinker sheriff hartman
well this expert dr egelhoffer from new york decides to make williams reenact the crime
i meant on my grandmothers grave dont be so technical hildy whats the story
wait a minute your mothers alive
youll get it now whats the story ill have the paper send the money right down to you i swear it on my mothers grave
never mind it thats not my money thats bruces money
never mind that whats the story
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley
exclusive thats great
no thanks ive still got those well ill step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn itll be kind of fun to see the boys again too remember bruce it must be certified
all right the check will be certified want my fingerprints
yes and thats putting it mildly no certified check no story get me
what do you think i am a crook
oh nothing of course you might cancel the check yes wait a minute what would be his first payment on that policy
what tricks would i pull
you keep out of this bruce suppose you examine mr burns in his office ill get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building you phone me as soon as mr burns has given you his check then ill go get the interview and you phone mother that were taking the six oclock train and no tricks walter
now youre talking
maybe youll be youre a smart young man you let hildy do this story for me and you can write out a insurance policy for me what do you say
were not interested
all right hildy im licked but ill make you and bruce a business proposition
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago if hes got twins this morning i claim it was done with mirrors
what do you mean
well its either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeneys
what do you mean only an act havent you got any feeling
what a performance bravo dont let him fool you bruce its only an act
how can you have any happiness after that all through the years youll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours i tell you earl williams face will come between you on the train tonight and at the preachers tomorrow and all the rest of your lives
you see what i had to put up with she never trusted me you argue with her otherwise youre going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands
why walter youre getting poetic
im an editor i know what ought to be written but i cant write it the way you could it needs a womans heart
no bruce dear dont you see this is a trick to get your sympathy no walter ive been waiting for something like this but i wasnt sure when youd spring it if you want to save earl williams life you can interview him yourself youre still a good reporter bruce and i will be on that four oclock train and thanks just the same
especially with an election coming up in a few days
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town
because it happened to be a colored policeman
if hes nuts why doesnt the state just put him away
so sweeney gets twins and earl williams gets hanged tomorrow
you said it
his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord they cant even find him i tell you drink is the ruin of this nation
what now
thank you
heres luck to the bride and bridegroom
anyway im glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things i couldnt give her you know hildy is about the best reporter in the country and that goes regardless of sex but all she really ever wanted was a home
i might have walter but you were never there
well ill tell you one thing old man she never looked at me the way shes looking at you
how do you like that here i am being nice to you and your sweetheart and thats the thanks i get
i suppose i cant call this off without creating a scene but remember its your last fling
thanks
allow me
oh im sorry
and when he walks with a lady he waits for her
what for
and he takes his hat off when hes with a lady
no kidding
you wouldnt believe this walter but bruce holds the door open for me
nothing personal i was just asking
now you got me
then what does he want with you
better
all right then come on and lets see this paragon is he as good as you say
afraid i should say not
youre not afraid are you
oh better not walter wouldnt do any good
say could i meet him
well hes waiting in the anteroom for me now
too bad i couldnt see this guy first im pretty particular about whom my wife marries
thanks
i wish you everything i couldnt give you hildy
the quicker the better well i finally got out what i came in to tell you so long walter and better luck next time
tomorrow tomorrow as quick as that
well ill give you a hint by tomorrow theyll be calling me mrs bruce baldwin

i dont know about water buffaloes but i know about him hes kind and sweet and considerate he wants a home and children
he does does he how did i treat you like a water buffalo
well i can and i love it he forgets the office when hes with me he doesnt treat me like an errandboy he treats me like a woman
oh sure its honest but somehow i cant picture you with a guy who sells policies
its a good honest business isnt it
the insurance business
hes in the insurance business
whats his line
not what youd call rich makes about five thousand a year
bermuda rich eh
bermuda
whered you meet this man
a journalist peeking through keyholes running after fire engines waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitlers going to start a war stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen i know all about reporters a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets and for what so a million hired girls and motormens wives will know whats going on no walter im through
i know you hildy and i know what it would mean it would kill you
thats why im quitting i want to go some place where i can be a woman
who says i cant youre a newspaper man
you cant sell me that walter
get married all you want to hildy but you cant quit the newspaper business
i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing im getting married walter and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as i can get im through
look at this
oh in that case the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it trying to blackjack
im not working for any other paper
great grief whats that other paper going to give you
please will you just
all right thirtyfive and not a cent more
listen you bumbleheaded baboon
if you wont do it for love how about money forget the other offer and ill raise you twentyfive bucks a week
get away svengali
dont mock hildy this is bigger than anything thats happened to us dont do it for me do it for the paper
thats what im afraid of any time any place anywhere
itll bring us together again hildy just the way we used to be
keep away
youve got to help me hildy
no
theres nobody else on the paper who can write thisll break me unless hildy
well havent you got anybody else
i dont care whether he did or not hes supposed to be covering the earl williams case and there he is waiting at the hospital is there no sense of honor left in this country
sweeney well after all he didnt do it on purpose did he
not yet might just as well be the only man on the paper who can write and his wife picks this morning to have a baby
dead
sweeney
whats the matter
sweeney you cant do that to me not today of all days jumping jehosophat oh no sweeney well i suppose so all right if you have to you have to how do you like that everything happens to me with days in the year this has to be the day
you you
well you practically did making googoo eyes at me for two years till i broke down and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed if youd been a gentleman youd have forgotten all about it but not you
i wasnt satisfied i suppose i proposed to you
it would have worked if youd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter but no you had to marry me and spoil everything
well the paperll have to learn to do without me and so will you it just didnt work out walter
i made a great reporter out of you hildy but you wont be half as good on any other paper and you know it you need me and i need you and the paper needs both of us
listen walter
why should i i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering
you wouldnt have taken me if i hadnt been dollfaced
what were you when you came here five years ago a little college girl from a school of journalism i took a little dollfaced mugg
i know walter but i
well go on and take it work for somebody else thats the gratitude i get for
you bet ive got a better offer
youve had a better offer eh
thats the first time youve been right today thats what i
you mean youre not coming back to work here
just what i said thats what i
what do you mean by that
dont tell me what to do were divorced im a free woman youre not my husband and youre not my boss and whats more youre not going to be my boss
sure you can come on
no i cant
you can break it cant you
i have a lunch date i just want
sure come on well have some lunch and you can tell me everything
walter youre wonderful in a loathesome sort of way now would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for
i havent any hard feelings
what
lets not fight hildy tell you what you come back to work on the paper and if we find we cant get along in a friendly way well get married again
well suppose we did that isnt what i got married for whats the good of look walter i came up here to tell you that youll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending twenty telegrams all the rest of it because im
deny it im proud of it we beat the whole country on that story
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky age sixtythree getting food and air out of a tube you dont deny that do you
was it my fault did i know that coal mine was going to have another cavein i meant to be with you on our honeymoon hildy honest i did
what home
well i dont want to brag but ive still got the dimple and in the same place i just acted like any husband who doesnt want to see his home broken up
a fellow your age hiring an airplane to write hildy dont be hasty remember my dimple walter it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it
well i meant to let you go but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry
well why did you promise me you wouldnt fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works
now thats a nice thing to say
i suppose thats true in a way i am fond of you walter i often wish you werent such a stinker
nonsense youve got the oldfashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever till death us do part why a divorce doesnt mean anything today its only a few words mumbled over you by a judge weve got something between us nothing can change
holy mackerel look walter thats what divorces are for
divorced me it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself it almost gives him a feeling he wasnt wanted
done what
you know hildy i sort of wish you hadnt done it
ill always remember it if i hadnt remembered it i wouldnt have divorced you
i notice you still remember it
youre repeating yourself thats the speech you made the night you proposed any time any place anywhere
oh yes i would id know you any time
no mama doesnt dream about you any more walter you wouldnt know the old girl now
maybe it was yesterday been seeing me in your dreams
lets see i was in reno six weeks then bermuda oh about four months i guess seems like yesterday to me

well a guy can win when hildy aint around
what have you got hildy
trouble is when the red menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying wolf
dont you remember hes the guy went to washington to interview the brain trust and gave out a statement that they were all sane it created a sensation
yeah what did he ever do for his country
this egelhoffers pretty good
that must be the tenth alienist theyve had on williams even if he wasnt crazy before he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him gimme the desk

and so do i
i was only doing my duty nothing personal in it
walter i cant tell you how badly i feel about this there was no excuse for hartwell to fly off the handle
i was just going to
take those handcuffs off our friends pete that wasnt at all necessary
i never saw him before
thats a lie
its a frameup some imposter
you drunken idiot arrest him the idea of coming here with a cockand bull story like that
throw him out frank

well looks like about ten years apiece for you birds
aiding an escaped criminal and a little charge of kidnapping im looking into but thats the jail there must be somebody there
a sight for sore eyes
look kind o natural dont they fred

if we didnt have election tuesday id have this on my conscience
now take that guilty look off your face pete and stop trembling like a horse

the governor gave me his word of honor he wouldnt interfere two days ago
but were going to hang him fred he cant get away
i know it but theyve got nothing to do with this case do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams were going to lose em
well theres a lot of communistic sympathizers around
williams aint a red and you know it
were up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented reform the reds with a rope
that gives you an idea of what im up against
if there was any way out
our families fred ive always looked on bessie as my own sister
i wish you wouldnt talk like that pete
fred i dont know what to say a thing like this almost destroys a mans faith in human nature
now pete please dont appeal to my sentimental side
fred
i mean im scratching your name off the ticket tuesday and running czernecki in your place its nothing personal and pete its the only way out its a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make
what do you mean through
pete youre through
if youre talking about my brother inlaw hes worked for the city fifteen years
twelve dollars for those rheumatic uncles of yours out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it
im getting them for twelve dollars a night
four hundred do you want to bankrupt this administration
now listen fred just give me a few hours before you make any decisions ill get results im doing everything humanly possible ive just sworn in four hundred deputies

i aint got time fred honest ill see you after
pete i want to talk to you

hiding him where
some halloween goin on outside the whole police force standing on its ear
well i was going but mollie fainted away and i thought i ought to do what i could
hildy i thought you were gone
from all i can get the sheriff let him out sos he could vote for him
any dope yet on how he got out
kings and sixes the pot affixes poetry i learned that at my grandmas knee
thats good
kings and sixes
well get you out in ten minutes
what goodll it do
let em take me its better that way
stop screaming mollie or were sunk im trying to think of something before those reporters get back
down the drainpipe i didnt mean to shoot him you believe me dont you mollie
howd you get here earl
dont cry mollie theres nothing to cry about
quiet mollie quiet
sure i do earl
wakin me up in the middle of the night talkin to me about things they dont understand callin me a bolshevik im an anarchist its got nothin to do with bombs its the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom you see that dont you
dont talk too loud
well maybe you think i could
oh im awful tired i couldnt go through another day like this
earl you must never do that again
keep away
i dont blame you earl if i were in your place i wouldnt trust anybody either
whats that only youre getting too near i dont trust anybody
earl theres just one thing i ought to clear up for the interview
no no youre right i dont want to kill anybody all i want to do is be let alone
sure you could earl but you wouldnt want to do that would you you wouldnt want to kill anybody
maybe youre my friend and maybe youre not but dont come any nearer you cant trust anybody in this crazy world say ill bet i could shoot you from here
dont move
earl you dont want to hurt your friends do you
yes thats right production for use
youre not going to shoot me earl im your friend remember ive got to write that story about your production for use
put down that gun earl
youre not going to phone anybody where i am
i wont earl
dont forget about production for use
yes isnt she beautiful
isnt that her picture
miss mollie malloy shes a wonderful person
no earl not at all who sent you the flowers earl
theres nothing crazy about that is there
very simple earl
sure you see id never had a gun in my hand before and i didnt know what to do with it well when i get stuck i know that theres an answer for everything in production for use so it came to me in a flash whats a gun for to shoot so i shot simple isnt it
is that how you came to shoot the policeman
a gun why to shoot of course
yes that makes a lot of sense earl
its the only answer everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose we could solve all our problems food was meant to be eaten not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved clothing was meant to be worn not piled up in stores while people went naked doesnt that make sense
production for use only well maybe thats the answer
id do away with the profit system and have production for use only theres enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if wed use some sense
how would you go about applying the golden rule earl
theyre very simple i believe in the golden rule im not the first man to die for preaching it but if they would only listen to it we could have a fine decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things
what are your beliefs earl
of course not i couldnt kill anybody its against everything ive ever stood for they know it was an accident theyre not hanging me for that theyre hanging me for my beliefs
you didnt mean to kill that policeman
i couldnt plead insanity because you see im just as sane as anybody else
i understand perfectly mr pinkus and as long as i am mayor
shes good enough for me and if i was to go home and tell my wife
a very finelooking women
heres the picture of my wife
youre insane
they wouldnt take it
you cant bribe me
get out of here

i told you i got drunk
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked really hooked but you let him off

your husband who has beaten you repeatedly

course i cant do much wriggling if you tie me up like that again massey this is one bad bad little girl
she said penetrate heh heh heh
they say the massey prenup has never been penetrated
and theres no talking her out of it believe me ive tried
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard i wish to execute a pre nuptial agreement
you did good massey
as you are well aware my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned i was slandered in court
howard
baby you are so hot
we realized wed always been very attracted to one another
and one day this sweet girl calls me asks me to lunch just a shoulder to cry on deal one thing leads to another and before i know it
honey i dont think this is really relevant to
here got pictures
sixteen years howard jr is fourteen and mandy must be what twelve

and we are sure
a wriggle room maybe we should put that in the malibu house screw the screening room
and without it that party is exposed a sitting duck no wriggle room
well at the moment thatd be me
understand what youre asking for here the massey prenup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in and earned during no one can profit from the marriage the prenup protects the wealthier party
i just want to make sure that you both
harvard whoa daddy

youre in check
denial is not a river in egypt
i was going to play golf you were going to have asian girlfriends
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon i was going to clerk for the supreme court
we did not
botox christ we had aspirations when we were in college
set one side for bel air
it was a gift from a client
why would you need two time zones you never leave beverly hills
its a lecoultre revers you can flip the face and set it for two time zones
no frown lines new watch
why in gods name would i want
its a form of botulism i just inject it into your forehead and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you cant raise them
what the hell is botox
you want botox
i dont need it
everyone needs plastic surgery you need it
not this one not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery which incidentally she does not need
so i wont be seeing her your clients usually visit me after the settlement
she got absolutely nothing zero zip
i thought so
sweet
fine they were created during a dictatorship what if something happened to you what would i tell little gus when he asked what was my daddy like
precastro
i dont see how we can ever find our way back from
murder
murder
income tax evasion
forgery fraud
youre forgetting howard doyle
your forgetting rex rexroth
you wounded me first marylin
yes i know its exactly how i felt when i realized youd hired the goon to kill
but then i guess something inside me died when i realized that youd hired a goon to kill me
its not something i wanted either
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us
hello miles
hello marylin
im not leaving you i took self defense
marylin run ill distract him

i believe the residence will be part of the settlement
meaning my house
i know so am i right and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service hes a dedicated underpaid graduate of southwestern university very tenacious and never more so than when hes dealing with an unscrupulous colleague i think its only fair to warn you im going to file an action miles and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within feet of my house
youre out of your league marylin rexroth was a primate im a professional
i dont have to thats what the irs guys do and they do it with great zeal see they work at these tortuous civil service jobs and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies these saps feel well they feel like saps and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath what is this a romeo and julieta
you cant prove anything

fabric and fringe

more pictures my god marylin you can open an erotic art gallery
i dont feel victorious miles i feel betrayed abandoned and humiliated i have pictures of him with another woman
to victory
although knowing you as i do there will be no settlement this time it will be complete and total annihilation
it has bones be sure to swallow one
i figure a couple of months thats how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry
have you tried the duck
well when this goes south promise youll have dinner with me
it was his idea it was a gesture of love and trust be happy for me miles
i am thrilled for you but tell me this howd you get howard to do it ive addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea
miles miles miles
yes hes a diamond in the rough and i have a feeling that someday soon youll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough
howard is a beautiful person
id like to offer my congratulations that was a beautiful gesture of howards
no thats not all
so i hear is that all
the massey prenup has never been pene successfully challenged
we told you we realized weve always been in love
but why him
no you listen to me you busted me miles you left me with nothing what did you expect me to do get a degree in counseling write a book about table linen because thats what wives do when they get dumped and frankly im not quite ready for that
marylin listen to me
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time
passionate hes a pervert he should have to register when he moves
hes passionate
to him hes a sick freak
getting married
absolutely
we are both sure thats what we want
that is correct not to blow my own horn but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law
that is true isnt it miles your prenup is the best there is
oh for the love of
have you ever met mr rexroth
hell regret this
yes why is that so difficult for you to understand
and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him
and youve always loved him
yes i loved my husband rex
well dont look at mine
oh im a lot like you just looking for an ass to mount
what is it youre after miles
gotcha

he wants a reconciliation
all right miles let me tell you everything you think you know i was married to rex for a long time i was an excellent wife a partner a lover a hostess and a friend there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together i got five years older think he should be able to ditch me for that
no i havent have you
you just havent met the right person
as a matter of fact im a huge fan
you dont believe in it
no
have you ever been married miles
not really youre not my client freedom of association big issue with the first amendment fans want to go to hawaii for the weekend
you didnt ask me here to pick me up you could get in trouble for that
who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight
i know you do
ill have the tournedos of beef and the lady will have the same i assume youre a carnivore
i told you i was hungry
why would you be here
how do you know
but you dont agree
ruth says youve been too successful that youre bored complacent and youre on your way down
what does your lawyer think
tell me mr massey what was your performance about this afternoon
see the tape then we can discuss my heart
not yet
did you see the tape
do you have a hard heart marylin
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery for where a heart is hard they make no battery
your husband told me you were beautiful but i was unprepared
isnt everything
i assume this is on rex
not according to mrs rabinow
these are yours
positano is beautiful remember when we were there rex we stayed in the santo pietro that hotel on the cliff
how nice
and you must be mr massey
ruth rabinow this is rex rexroth and you must be mrs rexroth
sometimes i forget
have you been taking your digestive enzymes
you have some
do you need a tagamet
my whole metabolism is off
are you alright you lost weight
marylin
hello rex
dogs
rex go away i dont want to have to sic the dogs on you
marylin
are you forgetting about the atcheson topeka and the santa fe
but marylin you know a divorce would ruin me right now everything i have everything we have is tied up in my business the business is my entire life
we are and its winding down
look marylin cant we have a civilized discussion about this
rex get away from the door
he tricked you with a phony wife and a fake prenup howard doyle he got you you married marylin didnt you you thought she had money ha ha ha howard doyle made you think that because of what you did to me and to marylin rexroth yeah i heard all about it my brother howard doyle got you neener neener neener
yes i know howard doyle
you ruined my life you sonofabitch gimme those
excuse me
youre miles massey you probably dont recognize me the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair
yes
wait i know you
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs he had a device he called the intruder
is not a challenge i need something i can sink my teeth into professionally speaking
shes here now
marylin rexroth when does she
im sorry mr massey but i felt certain youd want to know marylin rexroth wants to see you
please no calls im feeling very fragile
mr massey
when you have a moment
herb wants to see me
weve outlined a settlement
where does that leave us
thats attorney client privilege sorry miles but as a great and clever man once said whats good for the goose
why did she do it ruth why
dont threaten me miles i did nothing illegal
ill have you suspended ill have you disbarred
and its good
dont give me that crap thats my crap
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
i dont have a prenup
shes your wife why dont you ask her anyway i assume she signed the highly over rated massey prenup
did marylin end up with money
i have no idea what howard doyle eats im not a damn dietician
he never ate the prenup did he
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle they dont like the way you operate they helped her
he divorced his wife he married marylin he divorced marylin and he remarried his wife what kind of sick
rephrase mrs rexroth have you ever been in love
arty farty
kirshner does not apply kirshner was in kentucky
are you familiar with kirshner
yes maybe youre right miles maybe were being too conservative seventy five percent
why not a hundred and fifty percent
oh brother here we go
why only fifty percent ruth why not ask for a hundred percent
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets
so much for the icebreakers whatre you after ruth
heh heh
ha ha
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period
thats delusional
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice
my client has ruled that out
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation
so miles if you have a proposal lets hear it
oh just a routine mammogram she said to say hello shes going to positano with your brothers family
what
a yert ruth is a living legend rex at a time when most women are in boca having early bird specials shes working so her husband can be in montana in a yert
sam is sam hes taking up fly fishing hes in a yert in montana
so ruth hows sam
maybe i should reconsider my
in anticipation of making you sick
she brought my digestive enzymes
and she had private investigators assisting her
she always looked out for me
i think that went as well as could be expected
please let me handle this okay ruth forget kirshner whats your bottom line
whats kirshner
well is that possible
so you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear
i know that sounds rough but im about to close on a deal to develop some minimalls and im mortgaged up to my ass if this deal goes south im ruined ill lose millions
nothing
thats the problem i cant afford to give her anything
the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves well let me ask you this what kind of settlement do you seek what are for you the parameters of the possible
mmm and to cut to the chase forensically speaking is there a prenup
video
and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities
im not sure
not in court you cant has she retained counsel
i dont know i can assume
well with the expanding global population let me ask you this your wife has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the knockout sexy woman you described
seems like theres more of it than ever before
gotcha no need to get anatomically correct with me rex
you know what i mean when i say it
ah
no not exactly it didnt exactly cool marylin is a knockout and very sexy but theres a lot of it out there
time marches on ardor cools
but then but then
mm
when i first met marylin well we were crazy about each other not emotionally of course we just couldnt keep our hands off each other
thats her job you have to respect that
well my wife has me between a rock and a hard place
now rex
thank you
miles massey please sit relax and consider this office your office your haven your war room for the duration of the campaign
rex please
mr rexroth
should we counsel fear or trust should we seek to destroy or to build should we meet our clients problems with cynicism or with love
extinguish
the coin
yes its for your protection sweetheart youre the one with the the
the judge is here over here judge munson
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well
i tried to reach ruth but we couldnt get her
do you have it
the plastic surgeon i read about you in la style
kenneth this is my associate wrigley wrigley this is my friend dr beck
miles
wrigley
i know you would wrigley but would kramer

wrigley

of course of course she was married what else would she be single i dont think so
did you know mrs rexroth was married
no uh uh i dont think so hmm no well no
you were never invited to meet your soninlaw
no i havent but ive been out of town hello rex hello there
hard to believe i know im sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters
hi sweetie
mother
and how would you define your relationship to mrs rexroth you know you are her
we dont have much of a relationship anymore i havent seen her since before she married rex we had some very nice times prior to that we were quite close
now mrs banderas what is your relationship to mrs rexroth
yes but dont hold that against me im a little screwy myself
i asked you a question do you love her
a normal human being couldnt live under the same roof with her without going nuts shes my idea of nothing
do you love her
if you had half the brains youre supposed to have youd have done it yourselflong ago
she grabbed herself a perfect running mate king westley the pill of the century what she needs is a guy thatd take a sock at her every daywhether its coming to her or not
thats an evasion
a guy thatd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined
here you are do you mind if i ask you something frankly do you love my daughter
yeahwith all the trimmings now how about the check do i get it
you were taken for a buggy ride
listen did anybody ever make a sucker out of you this is a matter of principle something you probably wouldnt understand when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i dont like the idea of having to pay for the privilege
the average man would go after the reward all you seem to
well go into that some other time
youre a peculiar chap
all i want is thirtynine sixty if youll give me a check ill get out of this place it gives me the jitters
im afraid im a little confused you see i assumed you were coming here for
who said anything about a reward
the reward
what ten thousand
let me get this straight you want this thirtynine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars
whats the matter isnt it cheap enough a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars
yes i knowbut
why not im not charging you for the time i wasted
and this is what you wantthirty nine dollars and sixty cents
i sold some drawers and socks too im throwing those in
if i didnt i wouldnt be here ive got it all itemized
dont know id have to see on what you base your claim i presume you feel youre justified in
oh she does huh isnt that sweet of her you dont i suppose
please understand me when i say she didnt tell me anything about it i mean not until a little while ago she thinks youre entitled to anything you can get
thats typical of your daughter takes those things for granted why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami for the love of it
i was surprised to get your note my daughter hadnt told me anything about you about your helping her
come in sit down
yeah
mr warne
nono what the deuce do i want to
you neednt see anybody you can come directly to my study id appreciate it very much if
yeah but i dont like the idea of walking in on your jamboree just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain
i found a million dollar baby
cant you get them to go any faster this dissolves to a deserted road peter at the wheel of his car his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing
thanks
me forget it son i got millions
i was gonna do it but ma wouldnt let me she was ashamed i guess
going without food is bad business son why didnt you ask somebody
ma spent it all for the tickets she didnt know it was gonna be so much we shouldna come i guess but ma said theres a job waitin for her in new yorkand if we didnt go she might lose it
what happened to your money
we aint ate nothin since yestidday

oh peter what happened are you all right
if you do ill break your neck
never im going in and ask him

what were you going to do gold dig him for a meal
we dont need forty cars

youre such a smart aleck nobody can do anything but you ill show you how to stop a carand i wont use my thumb
you dont make me laugh
yes but look at all the fun you had mind if i try

now watch me im going to use number one keep your eye on that thumb baby and see what happens
here comes a car
hm yeah but its no good if you havent got a long face with it
amazing
oh thats nothing now take number three for instance thats a pip its the pathetic one when youre brokeand hungryand everything looks black its a long movement like this with a follow through
you figured that all out yourself huh
number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this that means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmers daughter
clever
but the thumb always works different ways to do it though depends on how you feel for instance number one is a short jerky movement that shows independence you dont care if they stop or not cause you got some money in your pocket see
well it is simple its all in the thumb see a lot of people do it
oh no
you think its simple huh
theres no end to your accomplishments

youre prejudiced
not a one
and rich people have none of those qualifications i suppose
to be a piggybacker it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature
thats silly
i dont think theres a piggy back rider in your whole family i never knew a rich man yet who was a good piggyback rider
my unclemothers brotherhad four children and ive seen them ride piggyback
your father didnt know beans about piggyback riding
yes
and he carried you like this i suppose

i was never built for these moonlight strolls why did we have to leave the bus
whats the matter
yes i noticed he was getting a little fat lately ouch

poor old shapeley you shouldnt have frightened him like that
yes
dont be silly nothing you can do must be tough on an old womana trip like this
i better go over and see her

maybe its time i moved to a hotel
i didnt know id ever need it again
ive missed the best sun why did you have to pawn your watch
ok
lets stay for a while
i like it here with you
yes one of my friends was there i wonder if you ever clipped her
fifth and mayflower you know it
where was that house the one in la i mean
last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg the girl must have been taking a break between customers it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and the reason im telling you this epilogue is that i felt that id come full circle
years ago in la i turned a trick on sunset and western the guy was polite and didnt argue about the price he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room the room had a bed and a dresser he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up i felt kind of guilty because he hadnt come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes but he said it was all right and began dressing when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and hugged me and kissed me on the cheek he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car i remember being relieved that i wouldnt have to work again that evening
yeah id like that
shall we go away for a couple of days
you be careful to im going to miss you
ill be back home around three if youre back by then we can watch tv or something i guess what im saying is that i hope you are back when i get home please be careful
they wouldnt know
maybe i should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what its like to sleep with you
no we already talked about that
do you want me not to go tonight
thank you sera
yes ill give you that
please
can we just ignore it
i dont understand any of that
can we just forget it
what was that all about
i think you should wear one at a time one of these and one of your others in fact i was going to buy just one but i didnt think it would fly as a gift i mean
your color
ok but remember that they wear it because they have to i wear it because i want to thatll make me look different lets get a drink
very creative now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers
be careful
why dont you go back to sleep ill go out and buy us some breakfast
thats amazing what are you some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies how can you be so good
heres my speech i know this shouldnt be acceptable to me but it is dont ask me why i sense that your trouble is very big and im scared for you and so im doing what i think you need me to do falling down in casinos is little stuff it doesnt bother me it has nothing to do with us
i warned you but im sorry
you were ok for a while so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck but i think even you knew that wasnt going to happen we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store even though i told you that we had plenty at home in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change i asked you if you knew it was a hundred you said you did so i let you do it we got here you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed
we
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home i also promised that we would never come in there again
thats impressive how did you do that
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me not like you wanted to hit me but more just waving me away security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street but i talked them into letting me walk you out
oh and what did you do
well i was prepared for worse but it wasnt so bad we were sitting at the bar talking about blackjack you seemed just fine a little drunker than usual but nothing really strange but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then wham you swung you arm at me and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress you smashed everything on her tray it was a real mess you kept yelling and yelling
very well umm i never expected to have to ask you this again but how did our evening go i remember getting to the casino i remember kissing you that was really nice but everything after that is a blank
how are you doing
i expect some kind of loyalty here just because i fuck for money doesnt give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly
what do you mean
well then i hope we dont run into any tonight
i like women who wear mismatched earrings
tomorrow night as a matter of fact
when
i am planning to go out and do some work
then come im going to change watch tv ill be half an hour
giving you money makes me want to come
do you want to go gambling tonight we could go out and play for a few hours
im going to fill it right now
nice talk ben keep drinking in between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool some interesting words fall from your mouth
i threw them into the garbage which was perhaps immoral but i wanted to come to you clean so to speak i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day
right the suitcase was clinking so what did you do with your clothes
whatever that means open your presents
ah yes i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck
thanks i do understand i was worried about how that would be but now im not and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job
and im not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life we know im a drunk but that seems to be all right with you and i know that youre a hooker i hope you understand that im a person who is totally at ease with this which is not to say that im indifferent or that i dont care i do it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement what im saying is that i hope you understand that i understand
i know that
no i think youre talking about you ill tell you right now that im in love with you but be that as it may im not here to force my twisted life into your soul
no
sera i hope that you understand how i feel about this first of all youre welcome to my money we can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest but i dont think youre talking to me right now about money
well ok
because its better for me that way ok

baron couer de noir is a blight gainst all nature we dwarves be not fighters still we are with you in this battle some of our handiwork may be of assistance
screwball you know and many other of the wee folk we serve as escort for our grand champion jack o the green
who might these friends be
twas jimmy done that i merely stood for the blame unfairly but here now ogg this be no time to rehash old differences ive friends along in need of safe haven for the night
or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples id forged
well bygonesre bygones i always say
honeythorn gump is it ive not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragons tears
friend ogg excuse our enthusiasm occasioned as it was by a fondness for you
youre good at riddles find the ring and the spell is broken
ill try
you must find the ring it completes the cycle answers the riddle
thats it then the ring
nay it was lost when i came up for air the pond was frozen over
and did you
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it said shed marry me if i did
go on go on
by the pond she was teasing me
where
i was with the princess
might not need a gesture quite so grand what were you doing the very moment the barons curse fell on the world
ill do anything face any challenge
tis not the wound thats sure not a scar remains were talking about a spell harder to repair than swordwork
the quests at an end and wheres the good of it a faerie festival over a pile of bones
she lives like all the world before the barons curse lifted now the worlds reborn yet still she sleeps
she lives isnt that worth singing about
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst
wheres your joy if you cannot sing
im not denying its a joyous day
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen a day so fair as forty springtimes
listen to him not in the mood
not in the mood im afraid
ive not heard a note out of you
a good day for singing
youre on your own like a true champion
hell not escape me
ride like wild fire jack
sapphire
ever wondered why jenny greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth
i could have struck off his head just now
never show mercy
hes getting away he was at my mercy
hurry up
dont get too far
seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead
tis a delicate operation lad requires a bit of engineering next
cant we move any faster
ah but you will and so will the baron when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway
hey stop it i cant see
patience lad
will you explain whats going on
easier than that jack screwball fetch me down a couple of them plates
plan on carrying some away in a kettle
sunlight
what weapon
nay lad were here to collect a weapon youll need fighting the baron
did you bring me here to sup
the kitchen be the most important room in a palace for if the victuals aint right little else is likely to be so
i admire your valor jack by all means seek him out but first we needs visit the kitchen
im not afraid of the dark
mean you to seek him out below
aye hurry now gump the key
sunlight you say
because sunlight will kill him quickly now give me the key
in the dark lad why should he do that
the baron hides in the dark in a passage under the castle quick give me the dwarfs key the one which opens any lock
the alicorn lad come to your senses unless we find baron couer de noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed
i dont understand
easily the question is can we save ourselves be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war
can you save her
nay youve not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine
the wound is mortal
shes sore hurt jack tis true but not dead yet
the princess lili ive killed her
nonsense course it matters
it doesnt matter
jack the courtyards been taken the barons forces are besieged in the south tower no sign of jack do you hear what im saying weve won lad
its what well find there worries me
aye were good as inside
best get down close to the moat lad
hell be atop the portculis ere long
fire away
then its godspeed screwball
aye before the wee pesties attacked
have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory
thats it
one more turn
there must be some way to get it up there
will you chance a miss
thats it the unbreakable line well tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis then ill climb up and chop down the drawbridge
faerie magics no match for a sorcerers power we have oggs gifts the key and the
what magic have we on our side
been telling you that all along lad
there isnt much time
and frog dont fly and bite like tomcats it be magic jack powerful ogres magic
water doesnt burn
never mind just do it retrieve the arrows somehow
there arent enough arrows
dont loose heart assemble the archers have everyone not holding a shield man a bow shoot the damned things as they fly
easily spoken
defend ourselves weve bested far worse already
a fine mess this is horrid nipping creatures what do we now jack
we do both our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under
why not mine the damned walls
well need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders
tells you something bout him what lives there
pray they dont turn out to be nightmares
on the morrow ill be awake enough to see if dreams come true
that be so better you pinch yourself now jack
aye so long as youre not too greedy for the bait
theres more than one way to spring a trap
it feels wrong jack like a trap
give in to despair and all is lost
its your own fear troubles you were here arent we for all the dark magic protecting it
dont like the feel of it jack
the chill is worse this night
never felt so cold in all me born days
no but what choice have we
can we trust him
but seem to have gotten lost on the way
aye we be on a quest to set the world aright
i know the rogue jack tis jimmy squarefoot
nay i show no pity to imps and fiends
hold jack dont strike
nay this time we strike first
wait jack
once you thought wed never find the greeks armor and look at ye now decked out like a proper hero
well never find the barons castle
long as we dont lose heart jack
why not admit it honeythorn gump weve lost our way entirely
aye lad weve little else to go by
well trust in faith gump
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course
heading true north we continue in that direction
easily said the raven passed this way hours ago
well find it
were blind now oona was our eyes and ears how do we find the castle couer de noir without her
no thank the lord but she be sore envenomed by the spiders bite
is she dead
stay on your guard jack the bug is enchanted surely
archers bring down that spider ill deal with this other creature
willful creature that one
wait
it bodes evil
what make ye of that jack
theres the way mates
gods blessing
going grows slower weve not made half a mile in two hours
well surely be in our graves if we dont
this rate well all be in our graves fore we reach the barons fortress
be gentle with them jack they only march to please you were this a faerie journey wed ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems
make haste weve a hard days march ahead
your strong right arms all the protection ill need this night
god protect you honeythorn gump
tis not the sword that counts but the man what swings it rest easy jack
were not in a tournament gump ah but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons
dont let this talk of heroes upset you jack sigurds sword is no great thing the volsung killed fafnir you killed lindfarne thats one worm apiece id say you and sigurd were neckandneck
stoutly spoke lad these dwarves be sore grouches pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling
i pray always to be worthy of it
gump youre putting words in my mouth
i should hope not
very secretive they are keep their feet covered up best if you dont mention it
certainly understandable
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet
shhh not so loud mayhap hell hear ye
oggs footprints
something the matter
my god look
pure gold it is plays a different note every time
nice piece of work
here is a bold champions reward to serve as a dwarfs doorstop
your imagination runs away with you jack those bones be but battlefield gleanings like i mentioned a wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited
better to kill than be disturbed
nay thats but to distract the casual visitor a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly
and this some of their handiwork
jack jack its dwarves live here hardworking chaps hammering in the forge all the livelong day make the most wondrous things they do
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable
nay jack tis not what youre thinking
twould appear other travelers precede us
beyond devils needle all is unknown
good
that would be devils needle last landmark i know in these woods
oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance
stealing his arms
well if the knight be already dead what harm is there in borrowing a thing or two
there it seems to quit ill wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing
ofttimes the wee folk come out to tend the wounded staunch bleeding with cobwebs give a parched mouth a sip of dew cool a fevered brow
what know you of fields of war
worse than the battlefield
jack dont
the foulest mayhap i can cut them free
foul fellow this couer de noir
aye hes enchanted the lot of them his reward for delivering the unicorn
blackheart
this is ogres magic
good plan that
send oona up above the tree tops she be our eyes
how do we follow a raven we cant even see
sounds like the bird we want all right lads follow yon raven
beware
birds speak to me all the time what did it say
im sure it spoke to me
aye said to follow it to the edge of night but is this the right bird
jenny greenteeth said follow the raven in her flight
whatever for
we must follow that bird
aye and hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying
track the demon to his lair
a true and troubling question gump well start from where the unicorn was killed the baron must have left a trail
how do you plan on finding this here castle if ye dont mind me asking
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour
finelooking army
drop a mountain on him and we wont need our troops
ill drop a cow on the knave
youll need more than bird droppings for blackheart
aye that too
save your mischief for the black baron
tricks is it why ill trick ye ungrateful whelp ill sour your milk and bird droppingsll fall from the sky wherever ye walk
weve no time for tricks this day honeythorn gump
im small and i can make myself smaller still small as a bee small as dust want to see me do it
the colts still too small
dont see why i cant ride too im second in command damn it
careful lad
damn them
it would appear so
pregnant is she
somethings coming
what is it
screwball you dolt ive a mind to change you into a toad
shhhh
well then youve got the sword and youve got the armor alls lacking is the steed
i believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield surely st michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven
no false modesty lad youre a proper champion achilles armor sits on you like it was forged to fit
by the grace of god
better we eat him than the other way round
there be no finer victuals than worm flesh lad
youll know it when you see it tis a splendid sight all covered with gold dont fear making noise dragons be deaf as tree stumps
whats left of me how do i recognize the armor of achilles
theres the spirit lad if ye run into trouble give a yank here and well haul ye up
you do the praying ive work ahead
better pray the worms a sound sleeper jack
knaves and robbers
now jacklad no ones asking ye to skewer the worm even st michaeld have a job on his hands for all that but the serpent hoards a pile of booty achilles armor among his treasures if we find our way within the mound and him asleep
so im to be a dragonslayer is that it
no less a creature than the lindfarne worm
and who might that be
a tomb it once was boy and a tomb it may yet be theres another in residence at lindfarne now
have we turned graverobber then
there it be lad the lindfarne mound kings long forgotten lie there lost in their final sleep
i know where to find it taking possession be another matter
twill take more than heart where do we find the armor of achilles for a start
bravely spoke youve the heart of a champion true enough
ill do what i have to do for princess lilis sake
time for a champion can you do more than pick acorns and rob birds nests jack
if the horn be restored the curse is ended
aye black barons mischief
did you hear twas the killing of the unicorn caused it
lamentable news jack but tis the fate of the living concerns us now
the princess is dead
fie on what she thinks you mind her claws and teeth cast your spell oona
and if she thinks me a liar
here now toss her this when youve the chance jenny greenteeth cant resist the sight of herself in a glass shes terribly vain praise her beauty and youll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle
dont get caught thats what shell suck your bones like honey comb
what do i do
aye that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells oona lure her out play the part of a girlchild
are we here
aye on the morrow we go but tonight tonight is for making merry
will you lead me to her
think there be truth only in beauty lad if youve the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws jenny greenteeth has the answers you seek
how is it this hag knows the truth
someone worthy of respect lad she be a water spirit lives in a bog down at seaside hideous creature to look at even by my doubtful standards devours little children she does when she can catch them
jenny greenteeth whos she
true but it wont come easy or free if ye want to ask ask jenny greenteeth
there must be an answer somewhere
course we care what goods the world locked in a season of death frozen up no folks to scare out of their wits on a summers night no babies to tickle no more spells to cast think thats an enjoyable prospect
dont you care about whats happened
if ye want more tricks im your man but for big questions ye must go elsewhere
then whats gone wrong why did it happen
that much magic i can offer ye a small measure of entertainment at best making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers
if youre looking for enchantment jack that i can give thee
dont you know
aye honeythorn gumpd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer
why has this happened to the world why is it winter now and dark
big question that lad why what
but but why
he is afraid of enchantment will you listen to the fool prattle on
please dont misunderstand i am grateful for your hospitality and
generally known what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots
well i i dont want to be rude but its generally known that
are ye afraid of me wine did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the wee folk think if ye sup with the faeries youll be enchanted
it looks er delicious such a fine bouquet very aromatic
elderberry wine no finer drink under heaven
what does she want from me
why jacklad she likes you is all and what hotblooded hero wouldnt welcome the affections of a fair nymph like oona here if your blood runs so cold boy you be a corpse before your time
mayhap you be the one whats lost and she safe by the castle hearth but come jack well warm your bones
i fear shes lost
ive laid eyes on no mortal but you this day jack
twas the princess lili gave me the answer have you seen her by chance
you have me word lad to answer a faerie riddle deserves as much

nay dearest jack you are to be my husband i want none other
youre teasing still
oh no dearest jack i meant every word
is what you said about the ring but another dream
seemed like weeks and weeks such a terrible dream i could never tell you
i cant have been under much more than a minute
sweet jack im so sorry you found me asleep dont know what came over me
whilst you were sleeping i fetched your ring
oh green jack what a dream ive had proper nightmare
and i love you
no dont let go you mustnt i love you
in the dark where i join him
so hes hiding in the dark
thats why he goes masked during the day
sunlight
sunlight it destroys him

no its not you hes afraid of its light
its the barons damnable work too cowardly to stand and fight he used you to save himself
youve freed me jack
no i wont let it happen
they told me you were dead
i was bewitched its better this way
i thought you were dead i
only whats right

i have no wife
be it fit for your wife green jack
tis not fit for a princess
let it havent you a cozy bower we might hide in
im afraid it may storm
oh la
my heart intends no more than that you love me as i do you
nay jack im but wary of your intentions
my lady mocks me
if i were your bride would the kissing ever stop do you wish to marry me jack
theres no happier thought under heaven
a maid must beware of flattery methinks you want to kiss me
tis the truth
jack green jack you mustnt flatter me so
not even the birds sing sweet as you
do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood
i dont want to be reminded of what happened
its powers are strong
i dont want it on me
there are many would pay a kings ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood
good theyll never catch him theres not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn
oh yes and the mare with him
he did run
it happened so fast he was hurt and ran away
how bad was the unicorns wound
my own father
they tricked you
i didnt know i didnt it was so lovely he was in my lap like like a baby and i
damned hunters it was a trap and you were the bait
my father and the baron
who
i dont know theyve hurt the unicorn
what happened
to fetch your napkin
where are you going
im not your judge nor have i any desire to witness the trial
ive no fear of failure your implications are most unbecoming
not if you be chaste tis an awesome test of virginity
hell not flee if i show myself
tis a fair question if you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap
jack
are you honest
oh jack mightnt i touch one it would thrill me so
they rival the angels of paradise
such grace and their smell its ambrosia
in these woods you are a commoner now be quiet true royalty approaches
i am a princess you have no right to order me about
shhh
how much longer
your command is my wish princess lili
the napkin will keep id rather not be alone
im not its master
dont leave me now i fear the unicorn wont show himself without you
ill go search for it
ive lost my napkin it was all elfwork and lace i must have dropped it when you startled me so
whats the matter
oh dear
be patient
what shall we do
that viper has envenomed the water no animal will drink here now
i detest serpents
only were he a fool to boot see yon viper
a gentleman would offer water
stop complaining
lets rest a minute im so thirsty
all right ill show you something sacred
a promise is a sacred oath
unicorn
oh fie what about the unicorn
blackheart aptly named
the baron is a frightful man they say hes an ogre he wears a mask so none may see his face
sport indeed
its my father gone ahunting the baron couer de noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport
or perchance
liar
i may have said perhaps
but you did you did
never
you promised
if you like
these for me
oh jack you are a wild man to use me so
greetings my lady the green wood is honored
another heros handmedown thurgis note the armor tis greek work
sigurds sword
his feet shall never cross my lips
step lively now
thought the weather terrible of late
we seek the ogre baron couer de noir he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter
grand champion is it and what great cause leads you to me
honored to make your acquaintance
what a fine meal youd make be the rest of you sweet as your tongue
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom
youll visit again
tis not the time to speak of cheer
dont be sad jack not with me here to give you cheer
this is sad news be it true
far as youre concerned shes dead believe it or not
i dont believe you
dead dead dead
no
shes dead
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky
as fair as me
exceeding fair
is she fair this princess
princess lili godwins daughter she was with me when calamity struck but after i could find no trace of her
princess i know of no princess
what became of the princess
ask away sweet man
nay tempting as your invitation be tell me one thing more
come sit beside me sweet boy and ill draw you a map
not very precise directions
follow the raven in her flight follow old black wing to the edge of night
where do i find the barons castle
youll need the fastest steed alive for couer de noirs castle rests at the very edge of the earth only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of achilles will protect you from his fury
how do i get the horn back
that would be the barons way therell be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot
couer de noir a demon if the devil ever made one
here be the death weapon the unicorns blood dry upon it
why then there thou hast we be lucky worse has not befallen us
a unicorns been slain the last stallion in all the country
dear lad what does winter bespeak but death it is a time of mourning this calamity is a curse something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world
aye and it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here i entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow most lovely of the lovely
i like well your conceit jack tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross all the heavenly angels must envy your grace
the moon is too round of face methinks
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you
think me fair do you jack
your fair smile be thanks enough better i stand afar to admire your beauty complete
come closer then jack that i might give you proper thanks
they call me green jack maam
well spoke boy you have discerning taste for one so young just who might you be
i bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty
whats this now

heading north still
is this a may day pageant are you all off on a lark the raven passed this way hours ago
you beware jack you and your porridgepot heart
be fair oona
i would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter
and as barren of love as stone
what care i for the human heart such a soft spiritless thing it is i prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves fierce and free and keen as steel
threats wont make me love you tis not the way of the human heart
why should i feel such pain should be the other way round i could vex you make you dance your life away

and sweet
you are fair as the first new flower of spring

im partial to oaks as are all faerie folk maynt i come visit sometime
i live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousandyearold oak my bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins theres no need of weaponry to keep the maids away
then tis not for chastity methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night
never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday
no fear of that now

where to
theyre trying to make me spend the summer here im leaving in the morning
what are you doing here
hey
hi
im hungry wheres my dinner who ate my dinner huh whos in trouble now
months
that would take weeks
to the patio and one northfacing window and six inches to the height
after your last extension request and with design review and the board of adjustment and the appeals to the city council was there an amended permit
i have the permit
well if it is we have a problem
its thirty feet
mr stevens one of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height hes filed to have construction stopped immediately
if thats what it takes
i assume youll fill theuh window with glass
i flushed it down the toilet
i hate to ask about a window
allowed outside the enclosed area
a sink
an exhaust system or a window is code
and if i enclosed it
oh yes
a violation
bob larson do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen
ive been dreading you
mr stevens
yes it is
well its the least i can do
thank you
oh wellthose arei mean we dont get to keep our work i could maybe ask them if you could choose one but you know frankly george you were the best computer models cant begin to match the beauty you gave yours theyre a part of this firm they inspire me i go out there and sometimes just stare at something ive designed it amazes me i would miss that too much look i may be going out on a limb but you go out there and look them over every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you just run it by me first just in case you knowbut im sure itll be okay
i built my first model here when i was twenty there are hundreds of them on shelves around the office twenty years of my life i was wondering if i might be able to pick a few to keep to take home only the ones that really mean something to me
what can i do for you george
ive got one favor to ask
good i was hoping for that
well i feel better about this now
for everything
i didnt know there would be a quiz george
it may sound that way but i react out of fear my life has nothing to do with what i like or dont like you havent been listening have you
then it sounds like im doing you a favor
from the day i startedto today cant stand it
what are you talking about you love your job
i hate this job
listenmaybe i can get you a year
i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead

ive been here twenty years
which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects it doesnt make a lot of sense anymore to want what we dont have and dont want what we do
im not
all of us are typing and clicking george whether we want to or not
typing and clicking myself to renderings isnt why i started building models
this isnt me we can show clients endless options change anything in a matter of hours on the computer but you wont change

you look better than ever
absolutely have him put it on a separate line at christmas well pact it so full of lights well make god wear sunglasses
dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for christmas lights with a switch inside
thats so weird
after everything
after everything he did to you and your mom
i loved him too much
do you ever wish you had done it
everything would have been better if you had youd have liked your grandmother and thered be a girl out there thatd have her mother i remember reading about her in the paper they couldnt find her father and her mother was dead i still feel guilty about that
i would have killed him
i think she was terrified of living with himbut maybe even more terrified of life without him
why wouldnt she leave
to hide a black eye
sun glasses
i was just thinking about my mom she wouldnt leave him i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses i mean it was dark outside and in but we never talked about it
are you talking
dont be and hide whatever that new drug is you have i like it
im proud of you sam
i havent used anything for two days im trying

why do you let your dog crap on his lawn day after day
i want you to find someone for me
god you look like crap george
i need you to do me a favor
its my day off i thought id help with the plumbing
i havent forced him to work i only wet him down once why would he leave
im surprised he hasnt left
check the permits it was built as a guesthouse its a legally rentable unit grandfathered when south laguna was incorporated
mr dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house
i know theres an explanation
ah oh
at least your father tried george
thanks for telling me
your kid was down around divers cover again smoking pot i didnt write him uptold him i wouldnt tell you
do you know what id give to have this forget how i got it i cant afford dirt in this town i live in riverside goddammitt and you get to piss in the ocean
it was in my name so he wouldnt lose it he stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title
left you this place
was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty
we just werent very much alike i guess i dont know i liked your dad more than i liked you
i aimed high
i dont even care if he ever comes back
shes a little sad is all
because dad left
she needs to be alone i think
its okay
oh sorry
i just wanted to know where mom was
three
how many bedrooms will your house have
not a perfect day
i better get the kids home
im an idiot to have you up there
dont move
its not my back thats killing me
are you going to kiss me
so could i
i could die
what
back neck back
ill be in the bedroom
what did he say
no goodbye no fuck you no are you in love with george
left you
peter left me yesterday
no mostly me
i kept thinking about it what you said i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me
i didnt think youd come today
is your back still killing you
you need to know what do i still love you
i need to know
lets not do this okay
if i werent married
you bit my finger
im married
i cant pick you up
it sounded like a pickup line
ill say a lot of things ive never said before its habit
youve never said that before
that was the truth
that thing about i was the most you know beautiful person you had ever known what was that
what did i say
when i picked you up from the train stationwhat you said
going on
nothing is going on with us is it
i can hire workers to help me
i thought we were helping
id rather you not be here
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us shes giving me crap about being away from peter and now youre trying to do the same thing what no one seems to realize is that peter isnt there hes not there and when he is he isnt so if you dont want me here or you dont want my kids here just tell me george ill stop coming but it wont be because of peter itll be because you asked me to stop say what you need to say because im not leaving until i hear it
what is it with this they wouldnt spend less time with peter if they lived here he has no time
how much time do they get to spend with their dad
i know theyre not much help but they love coming here george
its just that theres less that adam and ryan can do anymore id hate to have them bored
no why i like to be with sam
maybe you shouldnt come everyday
oh im worse much much worse
lets see if youve gotten any better
watch out for the smile boys
i smiled at him
tell him how you made me fall in love with you
this was my very first slow dance
its been a while
i think so
do you need help
youre a good mother
or wound let them keep their eyes and fingers
ill find something that wont kill them
i kind of said that maybe they could do something help im sorry they really wanted to come i really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me i dont think theyll be too much trouble
you brought your kids
he wont use my shower i dont get it
wheres sam
no imthanks i took something
do you need anything ill go to the pharmacy i have some demerol at home
my stupid back
i thought youd be up with the sun
youre not well
with your hands or your tongue
hindsight its like foresight without a future
ive been wrong a lot in my life
the antibiotics werent working its what i believe george
go in there and lick his attitude
my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him
ohwith his ear infection
that wasnt a dream that was sam
didnt you once dream you could lick people well though
it was perfect george amazing it was so real
finished or unfinished
i dreamed about your house last night
its not breakfast yet
im fine nothing ill drop by your lunch tomorrow
what is it
we have it on video was that when my parents were down for his sixth birthday i remember that
you head was pressed against my chest i could feel your heart racing and i remember i kissed your hair
the only time i can think of for sure i was holding onto sam in the ocean saving him from the waves
do you remember
it was just that maybe the way the sun struck the ocean the sound of the waves it was simple whatever it was then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good its been a long time
what have you been before today
i was up on the roof this morning tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has that im happy today
sams favorite
i dont even like turkey sandwiches what kind of pizza

which
i was here six years and i only hated two
but you hated four out of the five you did
i used to live here
what
it makes me sad

i didnt think youd know i went missing
im not talking just physically even your anger is perfect
what
youre the most beautiful woman i have ever known in my life
youre inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion
thanks for waking me up picking me up youre loud today
i called everyone everywhere you just vanished you could be dead
because he put the lock on do you think i told him he could have a nose ring why do you ask me everything you should ask him i dont know anything anymore
why does he have a lock on his door
he never answers
he doesnt answer
what are you doing
where he always is
where is he
lock the door behind you
you let him pierce his nose
did sam call to tell you he wouldnt be over this weekend
ring the bell before you try the door
you should lock your doors
i could use the money
its just a joke a stupid joke
im thinking its too weird now
he already knows everything about what he cant do you can tell him not to even look at you if you want
she wouldnt even fucking go out with until she was sixteen i mean thats not even a rule just her own thing she like figures things out on her own and then thats it
i wasnt sure

you want me to take you home ill take you home
oh im fine
so i was telling you my kid brother nickie got married last sunday that was a very nice affair and they had this statue of some woman and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth i never saw anything so grand in my life and watta meal im a butcher so i know a good hunka steak when i see one that was choice filet right off the toppa the chuck a buck eighty a pound of course if you wanna cheaper cut get rib steak that gotta lotta waste on it but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound if its trimmed listen clara make yourself comfortable youre all tense
sure just take off your coat a minute
no thank you i dont think i should stay very long
siddown take off your coat you want something to eat we gotta whole halfchicken in the icebox
come on inna dining room
yes i know
this is the kitchen
whatre you talking about youre a real likeable person youll make friends out there in portchester one two three youll have people visiting you alla time ill come visit you ill borrow my brother freddies car or you can call me up when you feel blue or ill call you up and its gonna be nice dont be so afraid
actually i dont make friends easily
oh you wont be so lonely youll make friends right away
im afraid of being lonely
i think youre kidding yourself clara i used to think about moving out you know and thats what i used to say my mother needs me but when you really get down to it that aint it at all actually you need your father you know what i mean youre living at home and you got your father and mother there and you can go on like that being a little girl all your life
well thats what i was saying my father is getting old and were very close hes a wonderful man really
why dont you just move out to portchester
its really a fine opportunity for me but im not sure i want to be a department head its mostly executive and administrative work well anyway i told you about my father and he depends on me a great deal and
i really should get home i told my father well i suppose a little while longer i wonder if theres any place around here i could put some makeup on
its only a quarter of twelve the clocks right over there
i really should get home
i only got about three bucks on me now but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue why dont we walk back to my house ill run in pick up some dough and lets step out somewhere
i think anything you want to do youll do well
wadda you think
thats true i do but im gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars thats a big note to carry because i have to give mr gazzara a mortgage and what i have to weigh is will it pay off in the end more than i can make onna salary
its my feeling that you really want to buy this shop marty
well the point is mr gazzara wantsa sell his shop now because he and his wife are lonely and they wanna move out to california in los angeles and live near their married daughter because shes always writing them to come out there so its a nice little shop i handle his books for him so i know he has a thirtyfive percent markup which is not unreasonable and he takes home net maybe a hundred hundred and fifty bucks a week the point is of course you gotta worry about the supermarkets theres two inna neighborhood now and theres an ap coming in at least thats the rumor of course mosta his trade is strictly italian but the younger italian girls they get married and they dont stick to the old italian dishes so much i mean you gotta take that into account too
i dont
well i wouldnt call it an elegant profession its in a lower social scale people look down on butchers
theres nothing wrong with being a butcher
so then mr gazzara he was a frienda my father he offered me this job in his butcher shop and everybody pleaded with me to take it so thats what happened i didnt wanna be a butcher
yes i know
im a catholic you know and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin
yes i know
when i got outta the army clara i was lost i didnt know what i wanted to do i was twennyfive years old what was i gonna do go back to my old job forty cents an hour i thought maybe i go to college under the gi biller rights you know but i wouldnt graduate till i was twennyeight twennynine years old even if i made it in three years and my brother freddie wanted to get married and i had three unmarried sisters in an italian home thats a terrible thing and my kid brother nickie hes a one got married last week so i just went to pieces i used to walk inna streets till three four oclock inna mornings my mother used to be so worried about me my uncle mario come over one time he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift he got his own cab you know and god forgive me for what im gonna say now but i used to thinka doing away with myself i used to stand sometimes in the subway and god forgive me what im going to say i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels
thank you

i think maybe youd better and connellid like to have the john doe contract all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter miss mitchell wrote for which i gave her a thousand dollars
i see id better stick to running the paper huh
whyuh
well im stuck with two and twobut im a sucker if i can make four out of it where do you come in
well
look d b im supposed to know my way around this john doe movement costs you a fortune this conventions gonna cost plenty
huh get what
well i dont get it
okay i just came in to get warm myself come on lets go
i want it as soon as possible
why d b youre not going to fall for
go down to the office and arrange for some radio time
okay beany bring em in one at a time wipe to montage half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ann shakes her head negatively
show me an american who can keep his mouth shut andill eat him
no no no the gals right we cant let the chronicle get the laugh on us weve got to produce a john doe now amateur journalism huh ill show those guys
if you ask me hank youre playing around with dynamite
better get that story in hank its getting late
miss mitchell do me a favor will you go on out and get married and have a lot o babiesbut stay out o newspaper business
thats right you got it sure he came in here and i made him change his mind bulletin editor saves john does life why its perfect ill have ned write it up oh ned
run a story say john doe was in here and is sorry he wrote the letter and
how
only one thing to do hank drop the whole business quickly
willoughby john willoughby long john willoughby they called me in baseball
whats your name
yeah me and a friend of mine hes outside
oh just traveling through huh
no
how about family got any family
well the paper said there were some jobs around loose thought there might be one left over
what are you doing up here then
no i didnt
did you write that letter to miss mitchell
there you see he admits it youre a fake john doe and for what youve done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand i hope they do it
listen folks its a fact that i didnt write the letter but this whole thing started
ah you bet your life you didnt you look in your papers ladies and gentlemen and youll find miss mitchells signed confession that she was the one that wrote it
no i didnt write it but
did you write itor didnt you
what difference does that make
and what about the suicide note you didnt write that either
yes i was paid but the
were you paid for itor werent you
thats got nothing to do with it
let go of me this man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building he was paid to say so do you deny that
thats a lie listendont believe what he says
its not a lie nickels and dimes to stuff into their own pockets you can read all about it in the newspapers there
thats a lie
no you wont youre through deciding anything
now hold on a minute young man hold on thats rather big talk i started the john doe clubs with my money and ill decide whether or not theyre being properly used
oh no nothings wrong everythings fine so theres gonna be a new order of things huh everybodys gonna cut himself a nice fat slice of the john does eh you forgot one detail mr big shotyou forgot me the prize stooge of the world why if you or anybody else thinks hes gonna use the john doe clubs for his own rotten purpose hes gonna have to do it over my dead body
is there anything wrong
say lets get something straight here i dont want any part of this thing if youve got an idea im going around lecturing to people why youre crazy baseballs my racket and im sticking to it come on colonel lets get out of here
why certainly with your ability to influence people it might grow into a glorious movement
well if theres nobody holding us here lets get going incidentally my name isnt doe its willoughby
theres nobody holding you here mr doe its only natural that people
look mr norton i think youve got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here
well i was thinking thatyeah you know sort of break the ice
you mean youd like me to do it huh
i bet you hed know how to say it all right and me i get up to it and around it and in back of it but but i never get right to it do you know what i mean so the only chance ive got is well if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of sorta prepare her for the shock
yeah yeah but look mrs mitchell you know i love ann and its gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because well you know shes so wonderful and well the best i ever was was a bushleague pitcher
uhhuh
oh yeah thats what i mean see it was easy as all that huh
good night john

i dont blame you
in a day or so i think

the reason why i wanted to take a walk mary is cause i wanted to talk to you
thank you
gosh she looks better every time i see her
ready
ill get my hat
yes if it isnt too late
you threw them out

well thats very nice thank you
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me huh well i dont know what id do without you youve made up for all the fakes that ive met

he did
the drums he taught me to play some
what did he play
yeah i know
he did i play the tuba
he played in the town band too
he sounds like a person worth while knowing
oh yes i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl i used to love to go fishing with my father thats funny he was a lot like you my father was talked like you too sometimes hed let me hold the line while he smoked and wed just sit there for hours and after awhile for no reason id go over and kiss him and sit in his lap he never said very much but once i remember him saying no matter what happens honey dont complain
you have
ive often thought about going back
gosh what do you know about that
probably as small as mandrake falls
really
im from a small town too you know
id rather have mandrake falls
i havent met anybody here that i like particularly they all seem to have the st vitus dance except you of course people here are funny they work so hard at living they forget how to live last night after i left you i was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and i got to thinking about what thoreau said they created a lot of grand palaces here but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them
you must have met a lot of swell society girls since youve been here dont you like them
oh i dont know
nothing
what did you mean by that
oh that
you said i was a lady in distress
whats that
you know you said something to me when you first met me that ive thought about a great deal
yeah anyway there arent any photographers around
heres a nice place
yeah i guess so what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other why dont they try liking each other once in a while
oh they just do it to sell the newspapers you know
im not worrying any more i suppose theyll go on writing them till they get tired you dont believe all that stuff do you
youre worried about those articles theyre writing about you arent you
why dont you try
you can almost spit on it cant you
theres times square
me oh i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier i see thousands of marching men i see general lee with a broken heart surrendering and i can see the beginning of a new nation like abraham lincoln said and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president things like that can only happen in a country like america
now what do you see
that depends on what they see
i say to most people its a washout
huh
to most people its an awful letdown
its wonderful
there you are grants tomb i hope youre not disappointed
yeah lets

i can understand that well take a walk around town meet you at the train at four oclock congratulations mr deeds youre one of the richest men in the country well see you later goodbye and thank you
yes you see rich people need someone to keep the crowds away the worlds full of pests then theres the newspapers to handle one must know when to seek publicity and when to avoid it
yeah a glorified doormat
no we wont the next time that jumping jack comes out ill straddle him while you ask him your questions
i guess wed better try somebody else
are you sure this is the town he lives in
thats pretty
its okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in
yes i know my first concern is to locate the lucky man when i do its your job to keep the newspapers away from him
but its a great story somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks
im not interested in the newspapers
mr cedar is and i havent seen him in two days listen cedar weve got to do something about the newspapers
hang up
sorry mac i cant yeah mac sure but i aint the attorney

youre not my attorney yet mr cedar not till i find out whats on your mind suppose you get the books straightened out quick so i can have a look at them
i cant hold out any longer either mr deeds being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair

hes capable of causing you a lot of trouble mr deeds
well if he has a claim wed better see him send him in
a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate tell him to see me at my office
why not who is he
oh yes yes i will
i mean about the power of attorney

i think you ought to give this matter some thought mr deeds
budington funny i cant think of a rhyme for budington yet
yes but thats an added service a firm like cedar cedar cedar and budington usually donates
that involves a lot of extra work doesnt it
oh nothing no extra charge

yes that is to say
besides wanting to be my lawyer you also want to handle my investments too
well you see your uncle didnt bother with that sort of thing he left everything to us he traveled most of the time and enjoyed himself you should do the same thing mr deeds
oh yes thereve been a lot of them around here already strangest kind of people salesmen politicians moochers all want something i havent had a minute to myself havent seen grants tomb yet
its merely a suggestion i dont wish to press the point mr deeds but if youll give me your power of attorney well take care of everything itll save you a lot of petty annoyances every shark in town will be trying to sell you something

sounds like a two weeks notice to me
there once was a man named cobb who kept semple away from the mob came the turn of the tide and semple he died and now poor cobbs out of a job
ive got one for cobb
nah
well whenever i run across a funny name i always like to poke around for a rhyme dont you
why should you
cedar cedar cedar and budington funny i cant think of a rhyme for budington
yes indeed i wonder why he left me all that money i dont need it
oh itll do in a pinch
well maybe it isnt to you but it certainly is a business to me if i have to make up a loss of if its losing that much money there must be something wrong maybe you charge too much maybe youre selling bad merchandise maybe lots of things i dont know you see i expect to do a lot of good with that money and i cant afford to put it into anything that i dont look into thats my decision for the time being gentlemen goodbye and thank you for making me chairman
because it just isnt a business thats all
why not
you see mr deeds the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business
now where were we
excuse me gentlemen theres nothing natural about that
naturally
me
well we were rather expecting it to come from you
i guess it is but i personally wouldnt care to be head of a business that kept losing money that wouldnt be common sense incidentally where is the coming from
the wrong kind there isnt any wrong or right kind opera is opera
well then we must give the wrong kind of shows
thats impossible the opera has never paid
but you charge i mean you sell tickets
we provide opera
we own an opera house dont we
why its an artistic institution
it isnt what is it conducted for
you see mr deeds the opera is not conducted for profit
thats what i thought if you dont mind im rather interested in the treasurers report id like to hear it
why the chairman presides at the meetings
wait a minute what does the chairman do
im chairman
oh yes of course youve just been elected
im chairman
well thanks i uh how do you do what is your name
my wife wanted me to tell you she she prays for you every night
oh mr deeds
thats fine thanks ill look em over later
heres the order for the plows we got a good price on them
sure everybodys a moocher to you a mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you
a farmer eh youre a moocher thats what you are i wouldnt believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles youre a moocher like all the rest of them around here so get out of here
yeah thats all thats worrying you what do i want a chance to feed a wife and kids im a farmer a job thats what i want
let me alone if you know whats good for you youll let me get this off my chest how did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse get a kick out of it huh got a big laugh did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings no
let him alone
no use in getting tough thatll get you nowhere mr deeds you know weve got letters
theres one nice thing about being rich you ring a bell and things happen when the servant comes in mr hallor im going to ask him to show you to the door many people dont know where it is
now wait a minute buddy
oh no im not i dont like your face besides theres something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million im surprised that mr cedar whos supposed to be a smart man couldnt see through that
youre making a mistake mr deeds
well we didnt expect that much im sure i can get her to settle quietly for one million
onethird thats about isnt it
mrs semple is entitled to one third of the estate
and dont ever get down on your knees again understand
mrs semple is entitled by law to onethird of the estate
oh that
i say we dont want to appear greedy
huh
of course we dont want to appear greedy mr deeds
oh well have to do something about the common wife
no i mean about my client
why i turned them down naturally
what about it mr deeds
sorry to keep you waiting so long those opera people are funny they wanted me to put up
youll excuse me wont you ill be right back
well what about it mr deeds
if she was his wife she should have all the money thats only fair i dont want a penny of it
im glad to see youre willing to be reasonable mr deeds
thats awful the poor woman should be taken care of immediately
yes sir
a child my uncles
commonlaw wife on top of that theres a child
what kind of wife did you say she was
i leave it to you mr deeds can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle
yes your uncles commonlaw wife she has a legal claim on the estate
mrs semple
yeah what if i am what about it
look hes temperamental
you mean to tell me you dont carry a pocketful around with you

mr morrow over there for instance just dashes them off
well i dont know i
why you must drink all poets drink
no i dont want it thank you
thank you your honor
proceed
no yes theres just one more thing id like to get off my chest before i finish
anything else mr deeds
personally i dont know what mr cedars raving about from what i can see no matter what system of government we have there will always be leaders and always be followers
please mr cedar proceed
oh yes i was getting to that your honor
mr deeds you havent yet touched upon a most important thing this rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune it is to say the least most uncommon
not at all
now about the falkner sisters thats kind of funny i mean about mr cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here do you mind if i talk to them
oh yes yes about my throwing those people out of my house mrs pomponi told the truth i did throw them out because i didnt want the party in the first place i didnt invite anybody mrs pomponi did all that they just came to see what kind of a freak the cinderella man was i dont know how people like that are supposed to act your honor but if that pomponi woman is an example ill stick to simple folks she just came in talked my ear off and took charge of everything if i were a friend of hers id have her examined
mr deeds do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home
an ofiller you fill in all the spaces in the os with your pencil i was watching you
a what
well i dont know where to begin theres been so many things said about me that i

tails tonight sir
right now its on the balcony
it may step out of a bazaar it may wait for you in a corridor it may hide in the shadow of a minaret
imagine we dont have to whisper any longer
we are not comrades any more we are friends ninotchka
i know but if we cant put in all these wonderful things at least lets put in some imagination in that one omelet well taste the whole of paris
and the surprise is theres nothing in it
des raisins de madre des framboises
lets fill it with confitures des prunes
i should be a swallow right now i would be sitting in front of the caf de paris picking up flakes of french pastry that would melt in my bill
if you asked him why he left france i bet he couldnt name one good reason
it is ninotchka it is he must have been in paris you can see it in his whole attitude he just picked up a crumb of our black bread shook his head and dropped it
thats another thing its spring
can you blame them at least the may day parade is over
how nicely youve fixed the table ninotchka
a little more tact look how nicely shes fixed the table all for us
i can tell you exactly
if you hadnt given commissar razinin such a wonderful report about us who knows what would have happened
thats right
imagine for once in our lives we were in paris and we never went to the eiffel tower
or we cant go back to russia
or it might be the firing squad
you must help us leon if you dont win her over were on our way to siberia
once in petersburg i was driving down the nevsky prospect in my cart and her highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction and when i couldnt make way quick enough she spat in my face
imagine the niece of the czar opening the door for us
thats her
positively not
no thats not him
possibly
are we free buljanoff
and little lady beatrice
and how is lord lavenham
hes a bad man sends people to siberia
you wouldnt like razinin
all right lets uphold it for another ten minutes
comrades comrades dont lets give in so quickly after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia
i dont want to go to siberia
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath
no thats bad management
we can say whatever we want we can shout we can complain look the service in this hotel is terrible see nobody comes nobody pays any attention thats freedom
lets forget the future lets stop being sentimental lets start that omelet
and if it is too late for you your children will eat it
just see how happy the people look from here
shes right anyhow lets talk ourselves into it
how many families live here with you
what a lovely room you have here
and thats something we owe to ninotchka
lets be happy that were all alive
thats right and we might as well face it
you know what they say theres nothing like home
leon how would you like to have three lifelong friends
yes we could stay with leon
what do you mean they might they will
and they might believe her in moscow
and leonitchka what she said about us
for ourselves we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants quarters
we had to take it on account of the safe
yes he looks like a comrade
that must be the one
a telegram from moscow it must have been here all day
what is it
misha misha
we like you leon dont we like leon
we dont like razinin
but what can we do we have to accept
hes cutting our throat
they accumulate millions by taking loss after loss
capitalistic methods
well just say we had to take it on account of the safe thats a perfect excuse there was no other safe big enough
now comrades i warn you if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble
where is your courage comrade buljanoff
just a minute just a minute i have nothing against the idea but i still say lets go back to the hotel terminus moscow made our reservations there we are on an official mission and we have no right to change the orders of our superior
why should you be afraid
well gentlemen im afraid our rates are rather high
may i ask how much your rooms are
monsieur
i am comrade buljanoff
no no
is there anything i can do for you monsieur
who gave you this idea what is responsible for all this
we are not only serving good food we are serving our country we are making friends
we have opened a restaurant
guest
shall we tell her
i dont know how i can get you out of it this time how will it end what will happen to you
all you have to do is say open sesame
friends friends buljanoff iranoff
with our cream situation what it is it is russia which should apologize to the cats
and there is a russian saying the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses
dont ask for it ninotchka there is a turkish proverb which says if something smells bad why put your nose in it
is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment i must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account
but comrades
good old razinin is he still alive how does he manage
dont forget the day will come when you will have to face razinin
i must be stern with you
it is high time you got out of russia
dont worry there will be enough
comrades im out of the omelet
i think i need my glasses
lets not close our eyes there are many good things to see here too
thats right
now lets forget everything except that were together
huh why dont you get a haircut buljanoff you all look so wintry comrades and why do we always keep the windows closed isnt it amazing at home theres still snow and ice and here look at the birds i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries now i know why we have the high ideal but they have the climate well comrades i dont think i need you any more
theres something else which i know will appeal to you a visit to the paris sewers they tell me it is extremely instructive
yes comrade
you might get me an accurate map of paris i want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city
is there anything i can do comrade
with two fs if you please
do you spell buljanoff with one or two fs
yes comrade
comrade buljanoff
we didnt want to get mixed up with lawyers they are very expensive here if you just say hello to a lawyer well there goes another cow
you didnt get legal advice
which lawyer
which part of the room is mine
this is the apartment we have reserved for you comrade yakushova i hope you like it
very good the last mass trials were a great success there are going to be fewer but better russians
how are things in moscow
well if your mother turns against you you have to look for someone to adopt you
boys boys dont forget russia is your mother country three sons walking out all at once thats too much for any mother
oh yes yes
didnt we put up a strong resistance
leon leonitchka why are you so good to us
about this telegram to moscow why should you bother ill write it for you
well gentlemen how about my proposition
not that we are giving in one inch but tell us what is in your mind
in any case gentlemen a charming beautiful exquisite woman i warn you if this case comes to trial it will be before a french court and when the duchess takes the stand
the former duchess
the duchess
you think because you represent the former duchess
emphatically not sir the prospect terrifies me now dont misunderstand me sir i dont resent your not paying me for the past two months but the thought that i should split my bank account with you that you should take half of my lifes savings that is really too much for me
oh youre a reactionary dont you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say hey you dalgout from now on its going to be share and share alike
no sir
isnt there any revolt in you sometimes when i order you around dont you feel like kicking me in the pants
no sir
i cant follow you gaston isnt it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position you being my servant wouldnt you like to stand on an equal footing with me
may i add sir that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of karl marxs capital on your night table that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust sir i view with alarm sir the influence over you of this bolshevik lady
ah theres something poetic about the simple processes of labor counterpane blanket blanket sheet sheet it should be set to music
well sir if you should do it again which i hope you wont please remember the order counterpane blanket blanket sheet sheet
and gaston i was happier all day long i felt id contributed something
decidedly yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed sir

if you will forgive me ever since you met that bolshevik lady ive noticed a distinct change in you sir
i am gaston

ali baba and the forty thieves into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights

he wouldnt say that what he would say is buljanoff you cant afford to live in a cheap hotel doesnt the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all phooey buljanoff
if lenin were alive he would say buljanoff comrade for once in your life youre in paris dont be a fool go in there and ring three times
i dont want to go to the hotel terminus
comrades if we ring nine times lets go in
they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in when you ring twice you get the waiter and do you know what happens when you ring three times a maid comes in a french maid

but buljanoff iranoff kopalski

too bad we have to waste all that time
well it means another two weeks in paris
two thousand francs if i stay here a week i will cost the russian people seven cows who am i to cost the russian people seven cows
a cow
do you know how much a cow costs comrade iranoff
a day
a week
two thousand francs
how much does this cost
what a charming idea for moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade
comrade
comrade kopalski
comrade
comrade buljanoff
i am nina ivanovna yakushova envoy extraordinary acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin present me to your colleagues
i am michael simonovitch iranoff
i am looking for michael simonovitch iranoff
right away instantly
yes monsieur
a special envoy is coming from moscow hell occupy the royal suite move our things to the smallest room youve got
but gentlemen i am afraid
thats even better
im afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault but there is one suite with a private safe
oh yes but have you a safe here big enough to hold this
i might be able to accommodate you is there some more luggage
monsieur
this is comrade kopalski
just looking around
yes monsieur
we cant but you are so ingenious leon
all right then make an appointment with her so i can see her
she doesnt leave her room she has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books
well boys id like to help you but what can i do yesterday i waited six hours in the lobby
leon leonitchka she is not going to negotiate she is going to fight that injunction shes going to make a precedent of it
whats new
if we say that leon well be sent to siberia
how does this strike you commissar razinin board of trade moscow unexpected situation here duchess swana in paris claims jewels and has already brought injunction against sale or removal after long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fiftyfifty settlement as best solution iranoff buljanoff and kopalski
all right go ahead you talk to the lawyer and ill talk to the judge
we havent anything to discuss with you well talk to a lawyer
yes a very slim one i want to be fair i dont deny that you might make out some kind of a case
we may have a chance
just a moment i hope you havent closed this deal monsieur mercier it might bring you into serious difficulties
now monsieur you have no right
dont make it difficult for me this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you
and kopalski
we will get that well get everything maybe a little bit later but well get it we must be patient finally we got the spring didnt we we got the swallows and you will get your apfel strudel too
yes a good piece of apfel strudel
now comrades there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry
even the swallows are back
the same spring we had in paris just as good
and its great think what it was a few years ago and what it is now
yes theres no doubt of that just look out of the window and there it is
sssh once and for all were in moscow
and your own gas cooker thats marvelous naturally its not the royal suite
well were back home
how are you you three scoundrels
no not a thing would you like to go out
if there is anything we can do for you
oh yes power and light thank you
i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you
you comrade iranoff go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property
yes comrade
we cannot feed the russian people on your intentions fifty per cent to a socalled duchess half of every loaf of bread to our enemy comrade kopalski go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris
we did it with the best intentions
will you send me some cigarettes please comrades i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time our next years crop is in danger and you know it unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people and you three comrades
i will not repeat your mistake i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture
i hope so for your sake let us examine the case what does the lawyer say
we did our best comrade
i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this comrades your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow
its a hat comrade a womans hat
whats that
no thank you
allow me comrade
why why should you carry other peoples bags
he is a porter he wants to carry them
dont make an issue of my womanhood we are here for work all of us lets not waste time shall we go
if we had known we would have greeted you with flowers
im sorry sir but i must insist
you want me to go in there
she has been asked to leave the powder room but without success we would appreciate if you would see to it yourself
what can i do about it
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike well if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous
give me another double brandy
suspicions nothing but suspicions thats the trouble with you if you dont let me in ill stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from russia ill picket your whole country
or a tunnel or a bridge
what for why
how do i know you dont want to blow up a factory
on what
why should i take a chance
now look here you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out
youre going to force us huh
thats impossible nobody has the right you cant do that if you dont give me that visa
oh no no visa
i must get into that country of yours
no visa
yes

the grand duchess swana active in the white russian movement

you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names
a funny story
quickly please tell me one of your funny stories
and general savitzky
how do you do
there have been cases but the headache the next morning is worth while if you drink it with the right toast to us ninotchka
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink its very delicate do people ever get drunk on this
from goats to grapes thats drinking in the right direction
its funny to look back i was brought up on goats milk i had a ration of vodka in the army and now champagne
its always good luck to launch something with champagne a battleship or an evening
i wouldnt know the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship
my darling
leon dont ever ask me for a picture of myself i couldnt bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer i couldnt breathe i couldnt stand it
ninotchka youre jealous
i suppose she is very entertaining it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous
ninotchka i love you
she is very attractive she has great elegance shes what you call a woman of the world isnt she
when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame i thought what a waste of silver thats all that interested me then now i would like to know what happened to the woman
i dont think so
did you make any change in this room
i promise i swear
if you dont want to answer you neednt but if you do you must tell me the truth
anything ninotchka
leon i would like to ask you something
leon i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say which i thought nobody ever should say because i thought it didnt exist and leon i cant say it
no go on
leon you know the jokes you told me a few days ago i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them now leon thats wrong i know theyre not funny theyre silly theyre stupid and still i laugh and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them then i realize who made them like that and instead of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat and if this keeps on am i too talkative
you see i couldnt shout that
not radio lets have music thats just for ourselves
a wonderful idea radio or records
well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket then could we have some music
thats when one half of paris says to the other half what are your plans for this evening madame
its nine oclock
twelve seventyfive from the clarence the sonofagun made a detour but he got you here
for twelve francs seventyfive
you see life can be so simple
ive never been here before i wonder whom youre thinking of oh i know a girl with a map figuring out each step worrying about north and south today now this might shock you i went up to a taxi and said eight rue du bois and here i am
you remember this room
foolish if this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself i would follow it from one end of paris to the other and when i caught up with it i would say just a moment you charming little dress i want you to meet ninotchka you two were meant for each other ninotchka feels more comfortable
i dont look too foolish
well so far it isnt funny but wait he says to the waiter waiter bring me a cup of coffee so the waiter comes back five minutes later and says im sorry sir we have no coffee wait a minute wait a minute im all mixed up a man comes in a restaurant he sits down he calls the waiter and he says waiter get me a cup of coffee without cream and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says im sorry sir we have no cream can it be a glass of milk
yes
he sits down at the table and says to the waiter did you get that too
yes
ill tell you that joke again a man comes into a restaurant did you get that
so you dont think thats funny it is funny everyone else thinks so maybe you didnt get it
no
not funny huh
maybe you havent any sense of humor well ill give you one more chance now listen
i dont think so
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it maybe the trouble isnt with the joke maybe its with you
no
i suppose you dont think thats funny
so do i now heres a great one ha ha ha well maybe its not so good lets forget it hows this two men are looking at the moon one says to the other is it true that a lot of people live on the moon yes it is says the other five hundred million whew replies the first they must get pretty crowded when its half moon ha ha ha
i wish they had never met
two scotchmen met on the street and i dont know the name of the street and it really doesnt matter well anyway ones name was mcintosh and the others was mcgillicuddy mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy hello mr mcgillicuddy and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh hello mr mcintosh and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy how is mrs mcgillicuddy and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh how is mrs mcintosh
i have never heard one
do you like scotch stories
probably not
well er lets drop it i dont think you would care for that one
on which boat
thats not a laugh i mean a laugh from the heart now lets see im going to tell you a funny story just a moment ive got it well it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america
ha ha now go back
no i cant leave you i wont not yet not until ive made you laugh at least once
then you should go back to your table
because we are an odd couple
why
at anything at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance if you cant find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me
at what
just smile
why
will you smile
what
death death always so glum what about life ninotchka do russians never think of life of the moment in which we are living the only moment we really have dont take it all so seriously ninotchka nothing is worth it please relax i beg you sergeant smile
but you have now and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death
oh ninotchka who wants to talk business if you win the suit fine if we win the suit better you do me an injustice when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal
your tactics are useless my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski
must one always be after something
what are you after
just an old man his memory is getting weak
but my dear child i am most at home among working men i hate the places where you circulate the hotel clarence this is my natural element after all what are any of us workingmen at least those of us who are worth our salt hyah
this is a place for workmen
i always eat here
then how did you get here
i didnt follow you
i dont like your following me
pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him you know that you hurt his feelings it was just like telling a musician you dont like music that good old man believes in food as you believe in karl marx you cant go around hurting people comrade yakushova but maybe you can make it up to him do you know how by eating everything with relish by drinking everything with gusto by having a good time for the first time in your natural life
so you want to make a strike breaker out of me i am surprised at you comrade is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch all i can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that royal suite
send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixtyforty what there is a strike in the kitchen good will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables what you wont serve me either now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me youre weakening the people
room service speaking
i kissed the polish lancer too before he died
but ninotchka i held you in my arms you kissed me
ninotchka you cant walk out like this im crazy about you and i thought id made an impression on you you liked the white of my eye
then do it through my lawyer
you know i want to
it is out of the question if you wish to approach me
tonight lets not represent anybody but ourselves
as a representative of moscow
all right fight me fight me as much as you want but fight me tomorrow morning theres nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy
i was sent here by my country to fight you
i have a better suggestion lets forget that the telephone ever rang i never heard that you are yakushova you are ninotchka my ninotchka
lets forget that we ever met
ninotchka or shall i say special envoy yakushova
i must go
but one of your friends may be in need of you you must answer
oh let it ring
the telephone is ringing
glorious analytical
oh my barbaric ninotchka my impossible unromantic statistical
thank you
no that was restful again
was that talkative
you analyze everything out of existence you analyze me out of existence i wont let you love is not so simple ninotchka ninotchka why do doves bill and coo why do snails coldest of all creatures circle interminably around each other why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates why do flowers open their petals oh ninotchka ninotchka surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion a general warmth in the palms of your hands a strange heaviness in your limbs a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing more exalting than thirst
its false sentimentality
i cant possibly think of a better reason
thats the way a clock works theres nothing wonderful about it you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration
its midnight one half of paris is making love to the other half look at the clock one hand has met the other hand they kiss isnt that wonderful
its twelve oclock
do you hear that
youre the most adorable cog i ever saw in my life ninotchka cogitska let me confess something never did i dream i could feel like this toward a sergeant
just what you see a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution
what kind of a girl are you anyway
dont pity me pity the polish lancer after all im alive
poor ninotchka poor poor ninotchka
a polish lancer i was sixteen
id love to tsk tsk tsk
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade would you like to see my wound
wounded how
i was wounded before warsaw
the bayonet did you really
its never too late to change i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm but i preferred the bayonet
im at a loss ninotchka you must forgive me if i appear a little old fashioned after all im just a poor bourgeois
dont do it please
id like to say it a thousand times
you repeat yourself
youre the most improbable creature ive ever met in my life ninotchka ninotchka
you dont have to do a thing chemically we are already quite sympathetic
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all
oh i see what do you use instead
you are bringing in wrong values love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it
your cornea is terrific tell me youre so expert on things can it be that im falling in love with you
look at me the whites of your eyes are clear your cornea is excellent
thank you
your general appearance is not distasteful
ninotchka do you like me just a little bit
that is correct
ninotchka
you pronounce it incorrectly ni notchka
i begin to believe in it myself since ive met you i still dont know what to make of it it confuses me it frightens me a little but it fascinates me ninotchka
that is why i believe in the future of my country
thank you thank you
you are something we do not have in russia
for mankind not a thing for womankind the record is not quite so bleak
and what do you do for mankind
keeping my body fit keeping my mind alert keeping my landlord appeased thats a fulltime job
and what is your profession
thats great im thirtyfive years old just over six feet tall i weigh a hundred and eightytwo pounds stripped
i will start with you
not too big and not too small what id call the typical room of an average man or shall we say a little above average now if there are any special aspects you wish to study i have nothing to conceal just look around thats my desk those are my books and here am i where shall we begin
i should say this room is eighteen by twentyfive
it helps it has ever since king david wooed bathsheba with the harp as i am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand i shall turn on the radio
is that customary
we take off our hat and coat we sit down we make ourselves comfortable we adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening we look at each other we smile well we dont smile how about some music
what do we do now
thank you ive had all the calories necessary for today
well may i offer you a drink or how about something to eat
the day will come when you will be free go to bed little father we want to be alone
no though the mere thought makes my mouth water
he looks sad do you whip him
he takes good care of that
good evening comrade this man is horribly old you should not make him work
yes
is this what you call the butler
i will do my best
then why dont we go you might be an interesting subject of study
now i didnt say that either naturally nothing would please me more
then you dont want me to go there
please dont misunderstand me
does that mean that you want me to go there
well lets say i live in it such a pleasant place all kinds of comfort easy to reach close to street car bus and subway
so that is your house
its not the structure but the spirit which dwells within there are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality
i see a house that looks like any other house whats remarkable about it
what a city there are the grands boulevards blasted out of the heart of the old streets the arc de triomphe made to greet napoleons army the opera and montmartre montparnasse la bohme and now ill show you the greatest attraction it will cost me a franc but it is worth it the most wonderful spot in all paris unique here look what do you see
i do not deny its beauty but it is a waste of electricity
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles it glitters
do not misunderstand me i do not hold your frivolity against you as basic material you might not be bad but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture i feel sorry for you
im glad i saw it before becoming extinct
yes it is
and thank you for getting me up here ive never seen this before beautiful isnt it
you gave me some very valuable information thank you
yes very strange
thats a strange angle
four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of fortysix feet on the side of the seine and twenty nine and onehalf feet on the other side the girders of interlaced iron work which stay the structure have an inclination of fiftyfour degrees
go ahead
the foundation is one hundred and fortyone yards square i hope youll forgive me but i thought youd
your type will soon be extinct
a russian i love russians comrade i have been fascinated by your five year plan for the past fifteen years
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence
you are very sure of yourself arent you
madame it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale
ill try
suppress it
i dont have to but i find it natural
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points must you flirt
here here we are here you are and here i am feel it
and where are we
bad manners to point with your own here the eiffel tower
why do you need my finger
now isnt that too bad the last time i jumped i forgot to clock it let me see eiffel tower your finger please
how long does it take a man to land
technical i couldnt help you from that angle you see a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint
is that thing lost again listen if you are interested in a view
no i am looking for the eiffel tower
facing north id hate to commit myself without my compass pardon me are you an explorer
correct me if i am wrong we are facing north arent we
love to
you might hold this for me
can i help you
youre welcome
thank you
no
in other words you dont know

have you never been caught in a similar situation
thats funny its interesting i never gave it a thought before
how many minutes between the first and second whistle
what
at what intervals does he whistle
well until the policeman whistles again
how long do we have to wait here
gladly
yes could you give me some information

the same old trouble leon youre always late whether youre taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop youre never on time and now when its a question of your reform late again by about five minutes
im afraid thats what it is
leon this has the ugly sound of regeneration
i have to be simple again swana and you may find it shockingly banal ive thought it over and im willing to take all the consequences even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living
say it over and over again leon words are a wonderful safety valve and thats what you need because you know its impossible dont you
it must be serious swana not long ago id have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class now i can say it without stammering without a blush im in love swana
and i thought it was something serious how could you frighten me so
there are a hundred ways to approach it but i feel it can best be said in one simple phrase im in love swana
brutal frankness if you insist
i know you hate the obvious but do you mind if at this moment im not in the least subtle
all right ill listen
this time swana just this once i must ask you to listen
oh no my little volga boatman have you forgotten our first commandment never complain never explain it has worked so often and so perfectly dont lets break the rule and please dont look so guilty otherwise ill

im the one who should apologize i should have talked to you before
did i act stupidly last night should i apologize
no thanks swana
leon darling how nice have you ordered tea or a cocktail

im going leon but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown madame yakushova is that what theyre wearing in moscow this year

now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you
darling if were going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open
you saw all that in one glimpse
timeless when she comes into a room youd think that the bolsheviks had taken over paris she wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by schiaparelli what a woman what a woman there is a russian snowstorm in each of her eyes
that bad old or young
you cant imagine
imagine the carpets of a self respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik what does she look like
well er i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby
you just told me you hadnt seen her
that wouldnt have done any good not with her shes the most incredible creature ive ever seen
that proletarian in the old days wed have had her flogged
no and believe me ive tried everything i must have telephoned her a hundred times ive sent her telegrams ive sent her flowers i asked her to dinner i offered her seats for the opera
you havent seen her yet
oh please swana i dont know whether im standing on my head or my heels here you are blaming me for neglecting you when im trying to concentrate on another woman and cant get near her
now here we have two very handsome softboiled eggs do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs probably not they have such unfeeling eyes well put in a great nugget of butter plenty of pepper and salt darling i havent seen you for three livelong days seventytwo hours
not in your condition make it tepid gaston tepid and tender and lay out his gray suit afterwards ill drive you through the bois slowly in waltz time
make it ice cold
darling youre taking my business affairs far too seriously much as id love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money i wont do it at the expense of your health particularly as we know we wont get much you look so pale pale but interesting
i just couldnt sleep i got up and went back and then got up again these last few days whew
dont tell me the bed has lost its best friend
no
is anything wrong are you ill
huh
leon what in heavens name
darling calm down why do you need a lawyer havent you your little volga boatman
it looks pretty hopeless there may be a chance thats all the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money thats all they are interested in those lawyers
what did he say
shhh but how can there be a question are you my lawyer or theirs all right ill let you know
what does he say
this is the duchess swana i want to speak to monsieur cornillon its very important please get him right away hello monsieur cornillon the most incredible thing has happened my jewels are here in paris three bolshevik swine are trying to sell them yes yes we must act immediately call the police have them arrested well then get an injunction but do something monsieur cornillon but they are my jewels there must be some way of getting them back
rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news
did i hear something about jewels
tell him i wont be able to see him for a half an hour
oh yes
hes a waiter at the clarence poor devil you know him
too bad brings our price down ten thousand francs
was i no not by a bolshevik
darling this would be wonderful just once werent you attacked by a bolshevik
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle toms cabin
ive got one chapter guizot thinks is terrific caviar and blood swana escapes over the ice
well two million readers i know exactly what they want chapter one a childhood behind golden bars lovely little princess plays with rasputins beard
yes im your little volga boatman
first tell me are you my little volga boatman
now swana
my little volga boatman stop threatening i dont deserve this are you my little volga boatman
imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments
i understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity they are willing to pay any price they have a circulation of two million
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr bertrands mouthwash i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid
sweetheart we wont have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past
oh leon
now listen swana i sold monsieur guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press
youd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots
those newspaper people
we can be rich if you say the word i had dinner with the guizots last night
oh leon you are so good to me
we can forget horse racing roulette the stock market our worries are over you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers you will be in a position to give it to me
did you win
darling i was busy looking out for your interests
dont you find that restful why didnt you come last night
your conversation has one marvelous advantage swana however many questions you ask you never expect an answer
its really a wretched morning wretched i cant get myself right i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle my face doesnt compose well all highlights how can i dim myself down leon suggest something i am so bored with this face i wish i had someone elses face whose face would you have if you had your choice oh well i guess one gets the face one deserves
good morning swana
hello leon
i will do my best
please dont waste my time comrade do your duty goodby
how can i make myself clear it is difficult to express but id rather not go to foreign countries any more please comrade let me stay here let me finish my work i am in the rhythm of it now i dont want to go away i dont want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again it throws one out of gear let me finish my work i have concentrated everything in it please dont make me go
i dont understand
i am sorry i dont want to overstep my position but please dont send me
that is for me to decide comrade yakushova
i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission i should hate to interrupt my present work i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne
yes leaving immediately
you want me to go to constantinople
it gives details which couldnt be invented naturally i want to verify it and thats why i need you
oh they shouldnt do such things are you sure this report is correct
as soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance if i told you whats going on in constantinople right now you wouldnt believe it those three have been sitting there for six weeks and havent sold a piece of fur this anonymous report was sent me they are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club here how can the bolshevik cause gain respect among the moslems if your three representatives buljanoff iranoff and kopalski get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didnt fly
may i ask what has happened
i havent either but ive heard about them you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal
no
well comrade have you heard from your friends kopalski buljanoff and iranoff
thank you
cigarette
please sit down
may i ask why
well comrade i am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else
i need very little sleep we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs
thats marvelous you must have worked day and night dont you ever sleep
yes
you mean you have finished the whole investigation
yes it does
does this include the products of the far eastern provinces
good morning comrade commissar here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months
good morning comrade

sorry you had to see that you were saying
so she did witness it
its a type of altered state it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning

so youre saying betty sizemore our betty sizemore who you were in swing choir with has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched youre amazing
a woman can write a check
you said a woman couldnt have done it
so suppose betty found out about them
anyway so what
junior year
and half the other guys in this town including you i believe
seems she was pretty familiar with ol del on a regular basis if you get my drift
yeah
i questioned joyce about all this
you better handle whats in this garbage can first
you just go write your little story roy ill handle the police work
bad idea
you bet i did i got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now
did you send anyone out there
they no longer live in tepees mr college graduate
so you think youre gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee
you think a woman did that
jesus
im tellin you it wasnt no woman roy
yes it was betty saw the whole thing your killers name is chloe
it wasnt a woman
she knows who killed del elden she said it was a woman
you need to get yourself gone from my crime scene and leave betty alone shes

and you should keep your nose out of another mans omelette its no big deal betty
you should get the order you want
its fine mind your own meal
i thought you said the eggs werent
why dont you go back to doing something youre good at like that lonelyhearts column ill take a refill there betty
you know elden some people actually read more than just the classifieds
yeah it was great really put the whole idea of church bake sales in perspective
i dont think i am
wesley didnt even want to come up here he warned me but i insisted i have to ask you bettyare you crazy
i wouldnt have put it quite that way but
so all this really was because of that soap opera my son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor a fake doctor
yes not the actor though the doctor i think
did did you really come here because you love this guy
when a roman general knew a battle was lost hed throw himself on his sword
whatre you saying
betty i dont wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison no way ive got some professional pride and i dont want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out
id rather not
ahh its too late anyway its too late listen i could shoot my way out maybe take one of them with me if youd gimme my gun back
this is really awkward
wait betty you still havent answered me
i better go check on them

wait a second i am not the reason youre here i was minding my own business living a perfectly boring life until you came along
youre sorry youre the reason were here
im sorry
thats my son my son is dead
yes but id sort of like to put that behind me now

thirtytwo
wait let me get this out i like the symphony walks in the rain sunsets animals and children i read passionately and i like to discuss things im basically conservative but flexible ive been involved in the death of thirty two people but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty two pieces of shit excuse my language
umm i dont think that
im appreciably older than you but my health is good i take care of myself and i got some money socked away youd never have to work again thats for sure id treat you like a queen
sure you could probably have any thing you wanted somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you dont even realize it
i am
i never meet people like you im a garbageman of the human condition i deal with trash mostly people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives but you youre different
to see you

im sick of looking at her mother fucking face
that was a really shitty thing to do
what the hells the matter with you
you dont look comfortable here thats cause you dont like being the center of attention do you nah youre like me

and turn that fucking music off
i know that
that woman could be in any one of four states four big states where the deer and the antelope play wesley were not in rhode island
there it is again that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place that make a statement do an end zone dance shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude thats dragging this whole country down the drain they dont owe us shit wesley when you finish the job you get paid we havent finished the goddamn job
they paid us half they still owe us half
what
half
they said find it find her find it finish the job you were paid to do
shes got class and poise lots of poise
okay thank you goodbye keep in touch
betty would never dress like that shes not some trailer park slut
lets get out of here we got another long drive ahead of us the fuck where i do not know but i know its gonna be long
youre always so coarse do her right here lets just see what happens okay i wish that i could find a way to speak my thoughts on mothers day there are no words that quite express my gratitude or happiness a pleasant smile perhaps a kiss i would not fail to give her this id make her glad the whole day through by sayin mother i love you ps i wish i could say this to my mothers face but i cant anymore
and then were gonna do her right here right
its not an exact science wesley he said theyll be here my houston contact has always been very reliable
thas it thas it conquer that bitch what timere they coming
well then did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband
wise beyond her years im sure and such poise too very very impressive
no like a worthy adversary wesley like a very worthy adversary
like us
oh for chrissakes it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining then cut their mommas throat and go dancing the same night
so what the fucks a finn
betty betty betty
you should read more listen to me i think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this and we gave it to her she kept to herself for years living with a pompous asshole then she sees her opportunity and boom she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust these heartlanders cant figure it out cause thats not their sweet little betty hah weve been tracking her for what three days and i already understand her bettern most the people in that shitty little burg
a finn what is a finn
no i see betty as a midwestern stoic type ice water in her veins a clear thinker probably a swede or a finn
yeah well if the wifes trying to sell it shell fuck up shes an amateur just like del was
id say that about torches her credibility wouldnt you
among others
joyce was screwing del
you think so joyce says shes timid
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day
i know i am lets just do what we gotta do here and get the fuck gone
i hope youre right
i can eat because i know we didnt kidnap that woman i can eat because they arent looking for us and i can eat cause im fucking hungry relax shes gonna end up on a milk carton and thats about it
maybe you dont appreciate the gravity of this situation its bad enough that we dont have what we came here for its worse that we dont know where it is and now this this was supposed to be my last job i already put the deposit down on my boat how can you eat at a time like this i get nauseous just watching you
we dont but a le sabrell be easy to find if its here town this size he said he gave his wife some car as a gift remember
so how do we know that cars still in fair oaks
you have to rise above it the professionals rise above that kind of thing
well no one ever spit in my face before especially some cracker fuck
what the hell was that another statement
wait any last words general lee
should i kill him now
hes telling the truth he doesnt know
actually i scalped him and then you killed him
dels dead by the way i sent him to the great beyond
im a yankee myself massachusetts
we can live with that
i like em small when youre inside a little asian chick its like your dick is the axle that holds her body together
mmmm well it was a piece of luck running into you duane i thought i was gonna have to take wesley out and hose him down all he talks about is those japanese gals
fine ill get you a bumpersticker but you better start believing it its the only statement you need to make
thats a good motto
let me tell you something in our business you cant put food on the table if your phone doesnt ring the guys who get the calls are good not flashy just good they get in they get out nobody knows a goddamn thing understand boom boom boom three in the head and you know theyre dead
i wanted to make a statement
why not itll confuse em gotta do something now that you fucked it up
you just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this
its not here lets go
what the hell does that mean if id told a ty cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat
well whyd you have to tell that indian story
i wasnt done i was just sick of hearing him whine and you didnt take him out you scalped him christ i almost puked did i tell you that
that one look you got i thought you were done so i took him out
what look
i didnt you gave me a look
i saw his soul wesley he was face to face with his god and no one lies in that situation but your geronimo act rattled me and i abandoned my instincts never abandon you instincts
i still dont understand how you knew del was telling the truth
i had to shoot him it was the only decent thing to do
well whyd you shoot him
we dont know which buick do we
he told us its in the buick
this is great just great now we dont know where the goddamn stuff is
that was to get him to talk get rid of that thing will you
you told me how to do it
are you out of your mind you scalped him
it sure is
im all for them owning casinos getting rich off the white mans greed its a beautiful piece of irony isnt it wesley
a mark huh
hold still del were just talking here then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut its amazing how easily the scalp comes off
it wasnt always fatal wesley we could scalp del right now and hed be plenty alive to tell us how it feels
hell of a way to die
you know a hundred and fifty years ago youd have been scalped for that remark about native americans right here where your house is youd have been scalped
so you see we have totally different ideas of whats stupid and whats not dont we
now thats really stupid
stupid is calling people in kansas city who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole and trying to sell it to them right wesley
that is so right
stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy
thats right
thats what i thought you better give me another example
no thats ignorant they just dont know any better
im just curious cant you give me an example
relax we brought the cash
wesley your wifes a very lovely woman have i seen her before
hey you got a fine one right here
beer please
bourbon little water thank you
mrs blaine i can tell you right now without a doubt that your granddaughter is alive and did not kill del sizemore
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed it would have been me
what do you mean
i dont like talking bad about the dead but now that hes gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldnt have and yes she of all people was the one who defended him and thats why what that sheriff said makes me so angry
betty was a lovely child
very graceful perfect form
this is betty at twelve
who doesnt
thank you for your cooperation just one more thing did she ever talk about getting rich
if it helps bring her back be my guest
i see may i
no she just wanted something outta life anything and with del she wasnt getting nothing thats her husband del im sorry about what happened and all but thats the way i feel about all of this
but she wanted more out of life right

i cant risk it
ill never get it polished in time give me a buckle zack
i dont notice anyone else complaining
hey man is the pissass money youre making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation
whos got two bucks its costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old lady and my kids in that motel
two bucks a buckle perryman look at that shine booniesll cost you five
he said its up to us and i got here first didnt i
how do you figure thats your bunk
zack it wasnt him he didnt ask me to dor i came to him on my own im glad its over zack i really mean that he was right i wasnt doing this for me

hes right zack it doesnt matter
i dont know i felt like like i was suffocating christ zack i was so scared so godddamn scared
sid what happened
jesus christ sid is everything your responsibility
no matter how it happened if she goes ahead and has it zack therell be a child in the world thats mine and i couldnt go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived
okay but what if its like foley said and she got knocked up to trap you is it still your responsibility
its mine
do you know that for sure
but it would still be my kid thats the point
not if she wont even talk about an abortion
i cant let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything if its my kid too then ive got a responsibility dont i
so whats the problem girls do that all the time
she said it was up to me if i dont shell go off and have the baby on her own somewhere
but she expects you to marry her
its a big religious thing with her and she wont even discuss it
doesnt mean shit get her to a doctor you cant do anything until you hear what he says make the appointment yourself
no but shes gotta be at least a month late
calm down sweet pea she seen a doctor
but it cant wait

youre acting like a child

thats ridiculous
youve done nothing but watch me watch me ever since ive been here treated me like a thug watched me like a hawk mistrusted me every time i leave the house that jane goes out and counts the silverware
you cant walk out of here like this
this is something i should have done a long time ago only i didnt have sense enough to do it no i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning but no more no more so thats that
stewart
and if its all the same to you im moving out
oooh i get you all right all right i dont blame you i kinda forgot myself for a moment there thats what i call getting me told isnt it anne
your house
now wait dont get excited anne theres no reason for that perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink thats all right im sorry ill go right down and throw them out thats no reason for you to take this attitude after all i certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house havent i
unreasonable have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom
now wait a minute arent you being a little unreasonable
the idea is simply this that i want those people to leave here immediately
whats the idea anne
have we got a play anne oh have we got a play of course most of it is gallaghers she did most of it that brain of hers just snaps like that all the time
i see
oh that mob downstairs i guess i got so interested in the play i forgot all about them
good morning what does this mean
oh hello anne he types furiously
thats exactly what you mean heaven knows youve made that clear to me often enough well im sick and tired of it ive given you party after party ive taken you to some of the best houses in this town and introduced you to people of importance and are you grateful no you insult them and act like a bore im sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that youve done perhaps its just as well youre not coming tonight maybe i can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you and what youre going to do
oh theyre all right anne but i
meaning my friends arent worthwhile i suppose
i dont mean the newspaper fellows that you dont like another gang i know youd love them theyre writers and musicians and artists a great crowd of people people who do great things people who are worthwhile
but i dont want to meet your gang
ill tell you what lets do ill take you and introduce you to all my gang would you like that

are you crazy
ill tell you what lets you and me sneak out all by ourselves
look out for my lipstick stewart
anne come here listen
yes ill tell you for the same reason ive never wanted to go out with those social parasites those sweetsmelling fashion plates i dont like them they bore me they give me the jitters
stewart would you mind telling me why youre not going
go downstairs and tell them anything tell them im not going tell them im not home
what am i going downstairs and tell those people

yes i said it sure i said it i didnt say it for publication however
is this true stewart did you really say it
you did thats a lot of hooey ill go and apologize
i thought i was very charming stewart
that was kind of a rotten thing to do anne after all gallagher is my friend the least you can do is be courteous to her
why down at the office we always look at gallagher as eh just gallagher thats all
no what do you look upon her as
yes isnt it
didnt i thats funny isnt it funny
yes as a matter of fact you failed to mention that gallagher was a girl
gallagher
you know stewart you failed to mention that miss gallagher was a very beautiful young girl
gallagher this is mrs smith
oh yes of course how do you do
sure my pal on the paper shes subbing for the society editor tonight
gallagher
anne prepare yourself for the treat of your life this is gallagher
oh yes you will wear garters
oh you cant carry a tune you cant carry a tune all you are good for is to sit and spoon spoon oh no i wont wear garters
oh yes you will my dear oh yes you will my dear youll eat spinach but youll wear garters too
oh no i wont my dear oh no i wont my dear ill wash behind my ears but no i wont my dear
oh yes you will my dear oh yes you will my dear youll wear garters and youll like it too
honey i love you ill eat spinach for you ill go to the dentist twice a year for you ill wash behind my ears for you but i will never wear garters
darling i dont care whether you can look gallagher in the face or not but youre gonna be a good boy and wear garters
besides id look foolish i couldnt look gallagher in the face
i know that
oh no no no not me i havent worn these things for years
you wear them of course silly
got my initials on them too theyre cute theyre nice little things what do you do with them
do you like them
little couldnt be an automobile could it well well aint that nice
ive got a present shut your eyes keep em closed i know youre going to love them
oh i love that nose its such a sweet nose
wait a minute ill do anything you ask me anne but i will not live
listen stew baby lets not talk about things like that now
it isnt cheap its nice
what do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat
never mind my nose what kind of a chump do you think i am you think im going to live here in your house on your dough what do you think my friends would all say dont be silly id get the razzing of my life for that a bird in a gilded cage thats what id be not me oh no not me
you have the cutest nose ive
now lets get this settled
of course i am stewart
look anne youre not serious about this are you
i see we wont need that plenty of room plenty of room
but we dont need it im sure
oh mother will give us the blue room you havent a red room have you well bless her heart wouldnt that be nice my oh my six rooms and two baths and a blue room i guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it wouldnt she
oh darling of course it would if it isnt there are six rooms and two baths but if that isnt enough mother will give us the blue room too i think
we could have the whole left wing wouldnt that be nice would that be room enough for us
when we you mean youd like to have me live here in your house
dont you think its silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
yeah oh its great of course it doesnt compare with this coliseum of yours here but twill serve mlady twill serve the architecture has a little feeling of missouri gothic and the furniture sort of leans toward oklahoma renaissance with a tiny touch of grand rapids
your place
i dont need any new ties ive got another tie ive got another one besides this one and its a pip too theres only one thing wrong with it you know what that is it has a little weakness for gravy and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup of course thats only in its weaker moments when you move down to my place ill show it to you
you ought to get some new ties stewart
whats the matter something i et no doubt egg marks the spot
im glad
a little sure ill be right up hes all right i like him
im afraid shes right mrs schuyler im really very sorry mrs schuyler that you feel this way i was in hopes that you would like me im not the burglar that you think i am after all were married i think the thing to do is to kiss and make up mother
now mother your attitude is perfectly ridiculous its done now stewart and i are married
thats because youre too far away stew
my name is smith well that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month im white male and over twentyone ive never been in jail that is not often and i prefer scotch to bourbon i hate carrots i hate peas i like black coffee and i hate garters i make seventyfive bucks a week and ive got eight hundred and fortyseven bucks in the bank and i dont know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet
none of your ideas can be goofy stew if they concern me
throw me out because im beginning to get goofy ideas and they concern you anne
why should i were happy arent we darling
howdido
hello natalie mr stewart smith miss montgomery mrs eames mrs radcliff mr radcliff
please go ill explain to mother
its all right its all right anne i can take a hint a bit subtle but i get it its all right
oh mother
not if youre going to lose any sleep about it
say you could do anything with me you wanted to putty just putty thats me now getting back to those eyes of yours would you mind if i kind of got closer so i could see them
im just beginning to believe that something could be done with you
you dont wear garters
me no most ordinary guy in the world me only one thing wrong with me
youre a bit eccentric arent you
yeah i havent figured out the plot yet but its laid in a siberian village
really
well you could make this table a little uh a little less wide there is something you can do for me miss schuyler
wont even pretend it isnt a very great favor i wish there was something i could do for you
i know but that was news this is blackmail and i dont like blackmail
youre a peculiar person why the other day i pleaded with you not to send in that story and
your mother will want to kiss me give me back my letters thats the breaks i get its the mothers that are always grateful to me here
i dont know how to thank you motherll be so grateful shell probably want to kiss you
for the letters of course
for what
will uh five thousand be enough
sure ill take a chance
will you step into the library
so its obvious huh
oh i dont need another guess its quite obvious
no give you another guess
i suppose youre going to print them
i stole them when i was interviewing babykins about bobo
where did you get those letters
im not interested smythe will open the door
ah but you dont know who bobo is and you dont know who babykins is
just a moment i dont see how that trash could possibly concern me
just listen to this adorable babykins does her miss her baby him sends his booful lil sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses bobo is so lonely
well maybe its a bit heavy for you perhaps if youd like something lighter something with a touch of romance
im not interested in your literary recommendations
yeah that was considerate of me i recommend you read it
thats considerate of you
well i tell you yesterday when i was here i had one of your books in my hand and when i got outside i realized i still had your book in my hand so as long as i had your book in my hand i thought i might as well take it home and read it this morning i got up and put your book in my hand and heres your book in your hand
what do you want
you may go smythe
thats a good idea telephone the police the number is spring get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge
youre all right
certainly right over there
may i use your telephone
oh thank you i knew youd understand
you know something lady if you sold life insurance id go for a policy in sixty seconds
no why not
youre not going to print this silly thing are you
decent why miss schuyler i want to be noble
im sure youre quite willing to be decent about this
i dont mind her if you dont
dont mind mother
i certainly will
give my regards to your managing editor
all right all right dont mention it
thank you very much
thats what i wanted to say but i couldnt think of it
why sure its a lotta hooey
so you see how silly that rumor is

its a swell idea gallagher hows this the wifes family lawyer comes to see the kid see to talk over the divorce then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony so the kid gets sore socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out hows that for the beginning of the third act huh
gallagher that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act

i wouldnt worry too much about it stew shell see it your way
very good
now weve got it right up to where the boys wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters hows that
nope afraid im all out of tricks tonight
now gallagher if we could only get a great scene a tremendously emotional scene something that would just wring the hearts out of the public to bring the curtain down in the second act that would be okay couldnt dig one out of your hat some place could you
all right thanks now lets see how will i start hey pal how would you start
here you are
you could be something ive got an idea gallagher lets get this set thats a great idea for a play pal get me a cigarette will you
what could i be
and theres her mother and what a character that old dame would make with her doublestrength and that lawyer friend of theirs hed make a great villain and theres you
oh sure shed make a beautiful heroine
gee thats an idea gallagher thats an idea there i wonder now
then why dont you write about something you know write about yourself and anne the poor boy who marries a rich girl now theres a swell theme

theres a better place for us to eat

i have a better idea of where we can go
nothing
what did he want
nothing
what happened
yes
is everything ok
your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window is that right you threw a hammer through a sliding glass door
my friend carlos is doing it who works with me its his its his pudding hes doing it its not mine hes crazy i told him not to do it hes the one whos insane he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though
i thought you said you bought all that pudding
no i didnt say that
im sorry i thought you said
no
so that was your pudding
yeah
thats insane that is really really crazy thats just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding
you see if you spent dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles
yeah no i see
you see
yeah
thats whats used to redeem the mileage so in noticing the pudding each cup had an individual bar code in other words two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is miles add in the coupon its one thousand you see
yeah
the promotion says buy any healthy choice products and get miles of airline travel or for purchases made with a special coupon so in the supermarket you notice their products first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at thats a pretty good dealbut then i noticed they had soup at cents a canand you start to do the math and you start to notice that its a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at cents a cup now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label thats those little bar codes you know the universal product codes
you were talking about the promotion
im sorryi lost my thoughts what i was saying
yeah
so that pudding was bought i bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion thats sponsored by healthy choice and american airlines its designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying healthy choice products they make frozen meals deli meats pasta sauce breads soups and ice creams this sort of thing
yeah
thats nice its nice ive been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways cross promotional work by some companies do you remember all that pudding
no no i did
did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that
yeah yeah we get along well you didnt get along with her very well
you like her
about six months
how long have you known her
yeah
thats very nice thank you thank you for saying that youre friends with my sister

weve still a few lone incurables prone to violence to perversion
my years tending the lepers at st emilion steeled me for lifes grisliest offerings doctor
of course everythings not as harmonious as it seems i hope youve a strong constitution
ever since his unfortunate death theres been a surge of interest in his work ill use the profits to restore charenton to her former glory
i dont believe it the marquis de sade youre actually publishing his novels
theyve the satisfaction only a hard days labor can provide
its remarkable doctor the patients are so subdued so docile
and the listless ones do the binding
im afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance were the laughing stock of all france but on a happier note
im pleased to have the new post sir
welcome to charenton abbe du maupas
a poker he took a poker from the fire
to seal the wound he took a poker from the fire
with that fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue
with that fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue
one day fanchon was visited by a surgeon he ran his fingers across her naked skin pulling apart folds of flesh inspecting follicles
one day fanchons first client was a surgeon he ran his fingers across her naked skin pulling apart folds of flesh inspecting each and every follicle
now give the signal
at your service count
yes well i awoke to discover id turned into a cat if you dont do as i say ill sink my little fangs into your drumsticks and suck the marrow straight out of your bones
im no longer a man i awoke to discover id turned into a sparrow
for fucks sake who else would it be the witching hours arrived youve alerted the others yes
marquis is that you
dont come any closer abbe gods watching
if youd grant me a final favor id like the chance to explain myself
youll hate me now wont you
dont come back not tonight not again
what whatve i done
go back to your room quickly
they incite us to act in ways we should not cannot a lesson the marquis would do well to learn
why not
madeleine i there are certain things feelings we must not voice
mothers not half so blind as you
by whom the marquis
its a sin against god for me to refuse your kindness but my hearts held fast here
turn you out
dont turn us out abbe
ive you to look after me havent i
charenton has changed its not safe for you here
is that a promise you can truly keep
i havent been to see the marquis for ages and i wont ever again i swear it i wont speak to him i wont even utter his name
the doctors a respected man a friend of the court
hes not the man whos cast a shadow here
in part yes
if i wasnt such a bad woman on the page abbe ill hazard i couldnt be such a good woman in life
why not act the role of heroines instead queen esther from the bible or st joan
i put myself in his stories i play the parts each strumpet each murderess
but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence
ow
its a hard days wages slaving away for madmen what ive seen in life it takes a lot to hold my interest
but why must you indulge in his pornography
dont say that readings my salvation
had i known your taste in novels i never wouldve taught you to read
not now or were both done for
i was wrong to free him but so are you for taking all his treasures his quills and his ink
his stinking breath caused my eyes to run thats all
has he hurt you
the next time you feel the urge to visit the marquis i hope youll come to confession instead
yes abbe
madeleine
we cant all we can do is guard against our own corruption
then how can we know who is truly good and who is evil
youd deny a dying man his salvation
i dont take my orders from you not anymore
i must grant him his last rites
mustnt do that sir
free his mouth
you neednt worry valcour its administrative nothing more
theyve got no right sending someone to sit on your shoulder i work for you i wont take orders from a stranger
of course
surely youll grant me a final word
im here
abbe de coulmier
tomorrow well cut out your tongue
i dare you stab my flesh which one of us will bleed
we inspected the body marquis she died a virgin
i fucked her countless times in every orifice and all the while she plead for more
then it mustve been love
never
was it impotence
whos to say i did not
why was it you never took her by force
go to hell
youre no stranger to rape marquis and yet with her you cooed you courted you begged
its not your province to ask
and did you
i wanted to fuck her thats all
i know because i felt it myself
dont confuse one organ with another
the passion in your heart
that was lust
i saw the longing in your eye
oh thats rich coming from her lapdog
its no secret that you loved her
so many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work i am blessed am i not
an innocent child is dead
for fucks sake abbe what am i to do police my readers as you police me suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned would you condemn the bible i think not
your words drove bouchon to
oh im to be blamed now am i
your wig remove your wig
its a potent aphrodisiac isnt it power over another man
now strip
oh but you must my pumpkin sex without flirtation is merely rape
i do not mean to flirt marquis
coulmier you animal
off with your clothes
i wasnt talking about madeleine
you expect me to pimp madeleine
a night spent with the partner of my choice
what on earth would that require
i could be convinced to abandon my writing quite voluntarily
what in gods name am i to do with you the more i forbid the more youre provoked
a man after my own heart
if it were up to the doctor youd be flayed alive
morbid gratification no i write what ive seen the endless procession to the chopping block were all lined up at the guillotine waiting for the crunch of the blade rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet abbe
its horrors perhaps its darkest nightmares and to what end nothing but your own morbid gratification
i didnt create this world of ours i only record it
because your writing continues unchecked
why this sudden torture
and your meat shall be deboned
water
orvolle his wine from now on nothing but water at every meal
virgin birth ha an entire religion built on an oxymoron
valcour his chair
thats a turkish weave you numbskull it costs more than youll earn in your lifetime
and my chaise am i being denied the privilege of sitting of plopping down my ass
his rug
my bed gone am i to freeze to death
then bugger me
good day marquis
youre tense darling you could use a long slow screw
thats enough
part the gates of heaven as it were
i dont know who you insult more her or me
madeleine shes besotted with me shed do anything i ask she could pay you a midnight visit
you always do
i have a proposition
whores and pederasts youre better off without them
ill die of loneliness ive no company but the characters i create
you know what sacrilege is dont you the last refuge of the failed provocateur
that monstrous god of yours he strung up his very own son like a side of veal i shudder to think what hed do to me
start with the bible its cheerier and more artfully written
try reading for a change the writer who produces more than he reads the sure mark of an amateur
you cant you mustnt ive all the demons of hell in my head my only salvation is to vent them on paper
perhaps in time youll earn them back through good behavior
if you wont be true to your word then youve left me no choice
what the devil
we held a mirror up to the doctor and apparently he didnt like what he saw
how can one man possibly be so selfish
he cant do that to me
dont be absurd its only a play
you mean to take us all down with you
honestly you cut me to the core whats the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if when i finally succumb when at long last i pledge myself to righteous conduct you regard me with nothing but suspicion have you no faith in your own medicine
if you only mean to dupe me again
do i have your word
youve a touch of the poet too perhaps you should take up the quill
you among them
fuck em theyre halfwits and pinheads let em die on the streets as nature intended
put yourself in my place ive your fellow patients to consider if charenton falls theyve no place to go no manner in which to clothe or feed themselves
mightier than the sword indeed
our future lies in the stroke of your pen
they cant be serious
more than your writings at stake the ministry has threatened us with closure
its that doctor fellow isnt it hes come to usurp your place here hasnt he
one more trick like this and ill be forced to revoke all your liberties
i thought that was your duty abbe not mine
but isnt that the duty of art to elevate us above the beast
its a fiction not a moral treatise
but we also fall in love we build cities we compose symphonies and we endure why not put that in your books as well
i write of the great eternal truths that bind together all mankind the whole world over we eat we shit we fuck we kill and we die
and such puny scope nothing but the very worst in mans nature
there i was taxed its true
its not even a proper novel its nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions frankly it even fails as an exercise in craft the characters are wooden the dialogue is inane not to mention the endless repetition of words like nipple and pikestaff
and
enough to discern its tenor
have you truly read the book in question or did you run straightaway to the dogeared pages
but youve no right to publish behind my back without my sanction
but you implored me to write for curative purposes to stave off my madness
what did you do bribe one of the guards
yes it is the papers cheap the types too small
ill fill page after page i promise
take your pen in hand marquis purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper maybe theyll govern you less in life
dont be so sure
im not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption
im entertaining you now arent i
in exchange we ask only that you follow the rules now you know as well as i do youre not to entertain visitors in your quarters
its true dearheart youve spoiled me pink
we treat you well enough here dont we marquis your very own featherbed in lieu of a straw mat your antique writing desk all the way from lacoste enough quills to feather an ostrich
i shouldve told you it was the blood of christ youd believe that wouldnt you
conversation like certain portions of the anatomy always runs more smoothly when its lubricated
its not even noon
care for a splash of wine abbe
gibberish my friend he rants and he raves
ive stared into the face of evil and ive lived to tell the tale now for your own sake let me write it down
no sir plainly put i never expect to sleep again
will you sleep soundly tonight
im not the first man god has asked to shed blood in his name i will not be the last
and you it mustve been an ordeal
poorly
how is the patient faring
and my own
my my you have exceeded my expectations
her name abbe
i beg you doctor dont make me say it
perhaps youll be so kind as to remind me of her name
he was so impressed with the marquis tale that he chose to reenact it yes
as you say doctor
youd suffer in her stead
if only blood will appease you then shed mine
madeleines not wicked its the marquis whos corrupted her thats not her fault its mine
this child let loose the beast from its cage
its a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children
hell do no such thing
what could cause a tincture like this
youll get more from her with kindness than you will with force
do more otherwise ill be forced to report to the ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum
ill do everything in my power
a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers charenton is a sanatorium she is not a circus the theater is henceforth closed as for your avowed friend playwright emeritus of the madhouse
thats not our intent
you ought to be ashamed abbe exploiting those drooling pathetic cretins for financial gain
no it most certainly was not
it was not inspired by circumstance
of course
it was fiction of course
oh indeed
madame bougival mademoiselle clairwil and of course the marquis wife
then ive friends of my own to visit
i have
you keep strange company abbe but if you truly have matters in hand here
hes more than a patient doctor the marquis is my friend
hes sworn to obedience
and
i spoke to him with reason and compassion the tools which serve us best here
well
charenton is my lifes work to have her wrested from beneath me now
and place my reputation at stake
on the contrary let me take up this matter with the marquis myself
you find this amusing do you
a practical man sir given the marquis unusual tastes a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent
youre a sentimental man
why so hell learn to fear punishment rather than pursue virtue for its own reward
have you tried bleeding him with leeches the calming chair maybe you should flog him at the stake
but hes one among some two hundred wards
in their eyes the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here
shut down
unless we set charenton on a straight and narrow course shell be shut down forever by order of the emperor
yes
abbe i admire you i do youve a conviction an idealism peculiar to the very young and so ill be candid the ministry has sent me here with the most explicit the most severe instructions
ive taken vows to live my life within these walls not outside them
all france is aghast at this book yet youve not heard of it
you have to believe me i had no idea
for sale to the general public certainly not its unprintable
do you favor its publication
its essential to his recovery a purgative for the toxins in his mind
well
oh that
and his writing
he no longer roars or spits he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards
what is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche
besides every wholesome thing he might desire he has at charenton a library filled with the worlds great books music lessons watercolor exercises
a man of his notoriety he wouldnt last a day on the streets without capture
and hes never once attempted escape
better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one
his wifes
his wifes influence
why is he in your care and not a proper prison
playing dressup with cretins that sounds like a symptom of madness not its cure
hes made a great success of our little theater theres seldom an empty seat not to mention its therapeutic value
i hope youll judge him by his progress here and not his past reputation
indiscretions abbe please ive read his case history at sixteen he violated a serving girl with a crucifix after six months in the dungeon at vincennes he mutilated a prostitute cutting her flesh with a razor then cauterizing the wounds with wax
a few indiscretions in his youth
i understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction
it seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy
if you dont mind my asking why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my our affairs
ill need an office on the grounds someplace to store my things
youre a man of science im a man of god charenton stands to profit from us both im certain
its a formality truly
of course
this may feel a tad awkward my friend but it neednt be ive merely come to oversee your work here understood
dr royercollard may i be the first to welcome you to charenton
i dont shed tears over the past monsieur delben i look to the future
his wife was trying to escape they caught her on the stair and set upon her with bayonets there but for the grace of god eh doctor
do you know how i define idealism monsieur delben
im afraid so hes an idealist youll have to be politic
charenton the administrator there is quite wellloved is he not
i dont seek popularity or renown monsieur delben mine is a higher mission
quite
but here at the hotel dieu we favor an aggressive course of treatment
what shall i ready asked fanchon my mouth my ass or my succulent oyster
yes ive got that bit
something to make the angels weep and the saints to gasp for air
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined
yes you shall of course you shall
whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet there armed with a quill of my own ill commit it to paper
wholl whisper it to bouchon
tomorrow night whisper a new tale to your neighbor cleante hell whisper it to his neighbor dauphin wholl whisper it to his neighbor franval
go on child
yes thats it a final volley from us both
you could whisper it through the walls of your cell
how do you propose i write it with dust upon the air
it neednt be not if youve another story
first and foremost hes a man you remind him of that fact and he resents you for it
hes a man of god hes true to his vows
dont be fooled madeleine he fears for himself hes like a man starving and you ha youre like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream
the abbes sending me away he fears for me here what with the likes of you
youre far crueler than i my sweet
i must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations
its only been described to me in your books
surely youve seen a man naked
they decreed me a savage and now they have made me one
theyve taken your clothes
i dont believe it
my newest book begins at my right cuff continues across my back and completes itself at the base of my left shoe
tortures so arcane so medieval even i havent the words to describe them if youve an ounce of pity in your heart youll throw caution aside and unlock my door
what have they done to you now
whats that then
the storys thrilling conclusion comes at a premium
you demand a lot from your readers you do
the climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap
its a long story this one
oh you you talk same as you write
the price my coquette is every bit as firm as i am
must i administer them directly or might i blow them
a kiss for each page
fiendishly so
is it terribly erotic
most assuredly
is it awfully violent
the unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass the darling of the lower wards where they entomb the criminally insane
ive just the story inspired by these very surroundings
your publisher says im not to leave without a new manuscript
youve already stolen my heart as well as another more prominent organ south of the equator
theres something else i want from you
if only these coins purchased your other talents too
i put myself at life and limb surely thats worth a few louis
the peril of composing such incendiary prose
i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours
its the only frontier i have left plumcake
you frighten me thats a good one im twice as fast as you are whod have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind
did i frighten you
go ahead youve a key slip it through my tiny hole
dont start
im hungry for a proper visit
and why not my fortune siphoned away my reputation past repair ive nothing left to lose silence my husband or youll come to know an infamy to rival his own
its libelous you wouldnt dare
public scorn carries a terrible sting trust me im a woman who knows
am i a cursed woman doctor must i be betrayed by every man i meet
youve no right to assault me in this fashion ill call for my footman ill have you removed
i can say with the utmost sincerity that every franc youve given me has been put to sterling use
if only youd remained true to our contract opiates for his nerves restraints the man warrants a bed of nails
this is neither the time nor the place
im on the brink of bankruptcy my husbands resources are all but exhausted and to what end i ask you
good god marquise
once long ago in the folly of youth he made me love him
of course
doctor can i impart to you his cruelest trick
and i in yours
i am eternally in your debt
now is the time to secure your epitaph the benevolent marquise charentons most revered philanthropist or satans bride
dont toy with me doctor
its beyond perversity that honor should carry a price tag
words alone are insufficient
oh but i am
if youre truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husbands celebrity
that illgotten funds borne of his degeneracy might now effect his salvation
what thought is that
what a beautiful thought marquise
its tainted money doctor
but youve a pension havent you from the sale of his books
i am not a wealthy woman
perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them
that barely covers the cost of his room theres nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments opiates to quell his temper restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves
i pay his stipend every month far more dutifully than i should
youre aware are you not that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton
oh you do do you it is my dearest hope doctor that he remain entombed forever and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms
i assume youve come to plead for clemency on your husbands behalf
with all due respect madame all france is familiar with your husband grant us a moment alone wont you monsieur prouix
youre new to charenton yes perhaps youre not yet familiar with my husband and his unusual case
i pray you be succinct
i beg to differ doctor you work in a madhouse your every waking moment is governed by the insane
my schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics
desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy
it is customary to write first and request an appointment
its a convenience isnt it having your husband locked away you no longer have to hold your tongue or hoist your skirts or crack your mouth so i can put it to its one pleasurable use youre not my wife no youre one among my many jailers arent you
he refuses to be seen in my company he blanches at the mention of your name
tell me have you done anything to secure my release no have you petitioned the court never sought audience with the emperor
give me back my anonymity thats all i ask let me be invisible again
its the way of all martyrs isnt it
everywhere i go they point and whisper at the opera they hiss at me when i take my box when i went to church the priest refused to even hear my confession he said i was already damned why must i suffer for your sins
you ought to court the doctors favor not his contempt
theyve put you up to this havent they
to flaunt your deviance in public upon a stage
youve come to lecture me
i beg you donatien as your wife your only ally you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself
how was i to tell you by writing a letter with what my asinine bride
how was i to know my darling
forgive me i beg you
for fucks sake woman bonbons im to sit here gorging myself on useless trifles sucking down your little sweetmeats when what i truly need what i truly require are a few quill pens perhaps a pot of ink
shame on you truly
hm tell me what other treats
you prefer a book to your husbands company
id rather read thankyou
id prefer to have our brandy in the salon there we can sit sideby side before the fire
very much
doesnt that please you
do as i say
but its just begun
leave at once
goodnight
he has it thank you
does he have your number mr jefferies
well if he calls in tell him to get in touch with l b jefferies right away i might have quite a surprise for him
im hired til one they went to dinner and maybe nightclubbing
oh when are they expected home
this is the baby sitter
this is l b jefferies a friend of toms who am i talking with
this is doyles house
thats what they call a family problem
i would say that is looked as if she wasnt coming back
didnt you take it to the crime lab
mrs thorwalds clothes clean carefully packed not too stylish but presentable
when the lock is broken yes
of course its normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope
get that idea out of your mind it will only lead you in the wrong direction
like disposing of their wives
namely
it was in her favorite handbag and mr doyle that can lead to only one conclusion
if that ring checks out well give him an escort so long
just dont dally thorwald knows hes being watched he wont hang around long
maybe you wont need it ill run it down jeff
precinct six i sent a friend over with bail money
whered they take lisa
in sections and one other thing doubting tom it just occurred to me that all the calls thorwald made were long distance if he called his wife the day she left after she arrived in merritsville why did she need to send him a postcard saying shed arrived
you think perhaps it was old hambone
i dont know what pet name thorwald had for his wife and that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase he wasnt taking his possessions because theyre up in his apartment now
like an old hambone
a fact last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden why because he had something buried in there something a dog could scent
a possibility
like mrs thorwalds wedding ring if that woman were still alive shed be wearing it
like what
i know what you told me she went in to get evidence and she came out with it
i told you that
my lisa she went into thorwalds apartment and he came back the only way i could get her out was to call the police
your lisa
listen to me lisas been arrested
look jeff dont louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be
tom ive got something real big for you
this is doyle jeff
jefferies
the police department at merritsville they called to report the trunk was just picked up by mrs anna thorwald
that depends on who they were
oh that phone call i gave them your number hope you dont mind
all the things i hate
if id been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane you wouldnt have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal a big job fame money
your logic is backward
but im not a killer
and how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it or hundred knives youve probably owned in your lifetime
well in the garage back home we
did you ever own a saw
you figured that out huh
that wasnt mrs thorwald who left with him yesterday morning
you sure it belongs to his wife
he has his wifes jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there
jewelry
everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom ready for packing
you think hes getting out of here
enough to scare me that you wouldnt get here in time and wed lose him
mrs thorwald
is is anna who i think it is
oh i almost forgot
forget the story find the trunk mrs thorwalds in it
yeah frequently it ran something like this your request for transfer turned down
ever get an answer
you know every day for three years i asked myself that same question
how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years
one thing i dont need is heckling you called and asked me for help and now youre acting like a taxpayer
what do you need before you can search bloody footsteps leading up to the door
a detectives nightmare
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment
i can hear myself starting out your honor i have a friend whos an amateur sleuth an one night after a heavy supper hed throw the new york state penal code right in my face and its six volumes
give him evidence
at the risk of sounding stuffy jeff ill remind you of the constitution and the phrase search warrant issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim he must ask for evidence
just make sure youre not caught if you find something youve got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules if you find nothing hes clear
now dont get me mad even a detective cant walk in anybodys apartment and search it if i were ever caught in there id lose my badge inside of ten minutes
whats the matter does he have a courtesy card from the police department
i cant do it even if hes gone
i mean when he goes out for a paper or a drink or something what he doesnt know wont hurt him
i cant do that
well then do a good job of it get over there and search thorwalds apartment it must be kneedeep in evidence
if possible both
doyle are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish
i hate to remind you but this all started because you said she was murdered now did anyone including you actually see her murdered
well what good is his information its a secondhand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself thorwald anybody actually see the wife get on the train
jeff huh
a very convenient guy this superintendent have you checked his bank deposits lately
the superintendent met thorwald coming back he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country
now how could anybody guess that they had perhaps signs on their luggage grand central or bust
the building superintendent and two tenants flat statements no hesitation and they all jibed to the letter the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station
the thorwalds at six in the morning
who left where
who said they left then
not yet
feel a little foolish
too bad the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time
i think thats about the time i fell asleep
six ayem
what time
until yesterday morning
then where is she in the ice box
she never left the apartment
i think they missed their chance with her
he has a six months lease and has used up a little over five and a half months of it quiet drinks but not to drunkenness pays his bill promptly with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman wholesale keeps to himself and none of the neighbors got close to him or his wife
i was jaywalking
by the way what happened to your leg
do that
we know the wife is gone ill see if i can find out where
thanks
i uh wont report it to the department let me poke into a little on my own no point in you getting any ridiculous publicity
all right you dont believe me
you told me ive got to run jeff
she was an invalid
his wife took a trip
for instance
i think you saw something that probably has a very simple explanation
you think i made all this up
almost everythings been done under panic but this is a thousand to one shot that mans still sitting around his apartment he isnt panicked
ill bet its been done
youve got a lot to lean about homicide jeff morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them that salesman wouldnt just knock off his wife after dinner toss her in a trunk and put her in storage
well officer do your duty
its too stupid and obvious a way to murder in full view of fifty windows and then sit over there smoking a cigar waiting for the police to pick him up
go ahead doyle tell me hes an unemployed magician amusing the neighborhood with sleightofhand
ill admit it all has a mysterious sound but is could mean a number of different things murder is the least likely
because everything that mans done has been suspicious trips at night in the rain saws knives trunks with rope and a wife that isnt there any more
you didnt see the killing or the body how do you know there was a murder
yeah
thats more like it goodnight old buddy
okay indochina tuesday well pick you up
i dont care where it goes just as long as im on it
jeff
the word is everything now what time does my plane leave tuesday
something wrong
its me
yeah is that you jeff
gunnison
hello
next time have some good news
well you know best call you later jeff
yeah maybe in the high rent districts they discuss but in my neighborhood they still nag
jeff wives dont nag anymore they discuss
can you see me rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry the electric dishwasher the garbage disposal and a nagging wife
its about time you got married before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man
ill ill get married then ill never be able to go anywhere
like what
listen if you dont pull me out of this swamp of boredom ill do something drastic
ill send you some comic books
ive been taking pictures so long i dont know how to read anymore
read some good books
youve got to get me out of here six weeks sitting in a tworoom apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors
so did you goodbye jeff
you asked for something dramatically different you got it
i didnt ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track
swell i get myself halfkilled for you and you reward me by stealing my assignments
youre too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with ill send morgan or lambert
stop sounding stuffy ill take pictures from a jeep from a water buffalo if necessary
with that cast on you dont
okay when do i leave halfhour an hour
you did
didnt i tell you didnt i tell you it was the next place to watch
indochina got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning the place is about to go up in smoke
where
yeah i sure feel sorry for you gunnison must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week
thats too bad jeff well i guess i cant be lucky every day forget i called
wrong week next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon
wrong day
gunnison how did you get to be such a big editor with such a small memory
this is wednesday
who said i was getting rid of it
for getting rid of that cast
for what
congratulations jeff
jefferies
then if the police get me you wont be around to laugh
i cant the police have it by now
tell her to bring it back
no
can you get me that ring back
thats a start im at the brevoort now ill be looking for you
i only have a hundred dollars or so
now stop wasting time thorwald or ill hang up and call the police
i dont know what you mean
for a little business meeting to settle the estate of your late wife
why should i
ill give you a chance to find out meet me in the bar at the brevoort and do it right away
who are you
well did you get it thorwald
did you get my note
hello
when those cops get a look at miss fremont theyll even contribute
what about the rest
i got twenty or so in my purse give me what youve got
thirtythree here totals oneninety not enough
ten here
first offense burglary probably twofifty the piggy bank
how much do you think youll need
one hundred and twentyseven
to bail lisa out of jail
what do you need money for
unless hes dumber than i think he wont wait til his lease is up
stella how long do you think hell stay there
when you took your first snapshot did you ever think it would bring you to this
thatll get her out of there wont it
smart shell be arrested
smart girl
whats she trying to do why doesnt she turn him in
theres no point in taking unnecessary chances give me the phone book lisa
you know miss fremont he might just have something there
now wait a minute
theres probably one in the basement
no
got a shovel
what are you two talking about
you dont say i might just take that compliment as an insult
you know you might not be too bad a bargain for lisa after all
then i wouldnt worry too much but lets keep an eye on her
no but it makes the rest easy to take and shes reading the bible
would four of them
i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter
you can tell that from here
miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules
what
i wonder
i have a feeling weve just begun
thank heaven thats over
look
you shouldnt have let her do that if he ever
theres something buried there
theres a dip at this end and since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks
and digging in look at that flower bed
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around
uhuh the dog i think i know now why thorwald killed it
mrs thorwald
ill watch the alleyway in case it goes that way
im just going to get the name of their truck
oh well yes and no it wasnt an official call hes just a friend an old ornery friend
you called the police
huh
police
stella i i cant tell you what a welcome sight this is no wonder your husbands still in love with you
uhhuh
goodbye mr jefferies ill see you tomorrow
its not an ordinary look its the kind of look a man gives when hes afraid somebody might be watching him
im not shy ive been looked at before
get back there hell see you
a federal offense
in this heat theyre up now
no the shades are still drawn in their apartment
what about this morning any developments
but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it
sometimes its worse to stay than it is to run
his personal effects hes probably running away the coward
he was taking something out of the apartment im certain
flashlights luminous dials for watches house numbers that light up
now what could he sell at three in the morning
isnt he a salesman
its hard to figure he went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case
he and his wife splitting up
well the salesman could be available soon
isnt there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction
and some man will lose his
poor girl someday shell find her happiness
speaking of misery miss lonely hearts drank herself to sleep again alone
and shell end up fat alcoholic and miserable
shes real eat drink and be merry girl
keep your mind off her
depends one which one
whatll you do if one of them catches you
i was
eyes bloodshot must have been staring out the window for hours
how did you know
the insurance company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair
she pay you much
okay but im going to spread some common sense on the bread lisa fremonts loaded to her fingertips with love for you ill give you two words of advice marry her
thats fine stella now would you make me a sandwich
when i married myles we were both maladjusted misfits we still are and weve loved every minute of it
ask for trouble and you get it why theres a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years then he refused to marry her why because she only scored sixtyone on a look magazine marriage quiz
people have different emotional levels that
baloney once it was see somebody get excited get married now its read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you cant tell a petting party from a civil service exam
weve progressed emotionally in
intelligence nothing has caused the human race more trouble modern marriage
theres an intelligent way to approach marriage
look mr jefferies im not educated im not even sophisticated but i can tell you this when a man and a woman see each other and like each other they should come together wham like two taxies on broadway not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle
thats the hard part
i can just hear you now get out of here you perfect wonderful woman youre too good for me
the only honest thing to do is call it off let her look for somebody else
probably but when i do itll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress a lobster dinner and the latest scandal i need a woman wholl go anywhere do anything and love it
youre never going to marry
can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a weeks salary in the bank if only she was ordinary
people with sense can belong wherever theyre put
its very simple she belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of park avenue expensive restaurants and literary cocktail parties
is what you want something you can discuss
too perfect too beautiful too talented too sophisticated too everything but what i want
shes only perfect
shes just not the girl for me
its happened before you know some of the worlds happiest marriage have started under the gun you might say
stella
her father loading up the shotgun
no
behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause what is it you have a fight
shes all right
nonsense a man is always ready for marriage with the right girl and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open
im not ready for marriage
thats abnormal
i dont want to
thats normal
she expects me to marry her
you must be kidding a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood
lisa fremont
gives your circulation something to fight what kind of trouble
dont you ever heat that stuff up
i knew it
those sultry sunworshipers you watch havent raised your temperature one degree in four weeks
how can you tell that from a thermometer
youve got a hormone deficiency
right now id even welcome trouble
it crashed didnt it
stella in economics a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market absolutely none
how
i predicted it
well i only quote from the best
readers digest april
goodnight mrs doyle
goodnight you idiot
he knows dont worry tess its a man
whos thorwald
tell him not to waste time calling to get over here soon as he can i think thorwalds pulling out tonight
ill have him call the moment i hear from him
im afraid it is tess
it is something really important jeff
not a word
you havent even heard from him
not yet jeff
jeff again has tom come in yet
yes
mrs doyle
hello
think youve got enough for a search warrant now
shut up im all right
lisa i i cant tell you how scared i was that you you might
get an ambulance dont move try to lie still
shall we vote him in stella
chelsea we scared him once maybe we can scare him again im using that word we a little too freely i guess i dont take any of the chances
how
ill try to give you at least fifteen minutes
maybe i can get thorwald out of the apartment
what for
now hold on im not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers but i dont care to watch two women end up like that dog
jeff if youre squeamish just dont look
and the last thing shed leave behind would be her wedding ring do you ever leave yours at home
suppose mrs thorwalds wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag during that phone conversation he held up three rings one with a diamond one with a big stone of some kind and one plain gold band
too close
wasnt that close
it could be the knife and the saw
somethings in there those flowers have been taken up and put back again
i know but theres one important change the flowers in thorwalds pet flower bed
its just a picture of the backyard thats all
well
hes washing down the bathroom walls
is he cleaning house
do you think this was worth waiting all day to see
in the whole courtyard only one person didnt come to the window
but youre not
for a minute doyle almost had me convinced i was wrong
well if there was one less thread this way and two less that way i might give up bachelorhood
do you like it
thank you
ill rephrase the question
no lisa i dont think he did
did mr doyle think i stole this case
i think ill start reviving it tomorrow with say miss torso for a start
whatever happened to that old saying love thy neighbor
you and me with long faces plunged into despair because we find out that a man didnt kill his wife were two of the most frightening ghouls ive ever known
huh
jeff if anybody walked in here i dont think theyd believe what they see
of course they have the same chance they can look at me like a bug under glass if they want to
im not much on rear window ethics
do you suppose its ethical to watch a man with binoculars and a long focus lens until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck and almost read his mail do you suppose its ethical even if you prove he didnt commit a crime
who was the trunk addressed to
i hate funny exit lines
exactly what i had in mind along with some brandy
you mean like the kitchen and make us some coffee
weird why dont i slip into something comfortable
but he never ends up marrying her strange
the same
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls and overpassionate daughters of the rich
surprise is the most important element of attack and beside youre not up on your private eye literature when theyre in trouble its always their girl friday who gets them out of it
staying the night here uninvited
i do
you are you have a talent for creating difficult situations
its utterly beautiful i wish i could be creative
from his landlord once a month
id be no better than thorwald to refuse
ill trade you my feminine intuition for a bed for the night
a mark cross overnight case anyway compact but ample enough
thats a suitcase
you said id have to live out of one suitcase ill bet yours isnt this small
lisa i wont be able to give you any
say anything else and ill stay tomorrow night too
well thats fine but i only have one bed and
i have the whole weekend off
youll have to clear that through my landlord
night im going to stay with you
we have all what
dont rush me we have all night
dont be too hard on him hes a steady worker i wish hed get there though
id like to see your friends face when we tell him he doesnt sound like much of a detective
well agree they saw a woman but she wasnt mrs thorwald that is yet
still those witnesses
well i have a pat rebuttal for mr doyle that couldnt be mrs thorwald or i dont know women
thats what the witnesses told him
that mrs thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband
im with you sweetie but detective thomas j doyle has a pat answer for that
basic equipment you dont leave it behind in your husbands drawer in your favorite handbag
inside stuff
they do not and they dont leave it behind them a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup perfume and jewelry
do they hide it in their husbands clothes
but only her husband would know that and the jewelry women dont keep all their jewelry in a purse all tangled getting scratched and twisted up
because she didnt know she was going on a trip and where she was going she wouldnt need a handbag
a woman has a favorite handbag it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it then she takes a trip and leaves it behind why
lisa i cant guess what youre thinking
women arent that unpredictable
what doesnt
it doesnt make sense to me
something on your mind lisa
not a word he was going to check on the railroad station and the trunk he must be still on it
and you and you friend doyle did you hear from him again since he left
thinking about thorwald
all day long ive tried to keep my mind on work
not yet
well i guess its safe to put on some lights now
he will all his things are still piled on the bed
suppose he doesnt come back again
i dont know
i wonder where hes going now
i never saw him ask her for advise before but she volunteered plenty
someone not his wife
he had it hidden in the dresser well at least it was in there he took it out went to the phone and called somebody long distance his wifes jewelry was in the handbag and something about it worried him he was asking somebody advice over the phone
what about it
that alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost
he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds coats suits shirts sox even his wifes
it doesnt seem to be in any hurry
all right but whats he doing now
to get on home
okay chief whats my next assignment
west ninth street
whats the apartment house number
the name on the second floor rear mailbox reads mr and mrs lars thats lars lars thorwald
okay lisa probably youre right hes probably in the bedroom now entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick ill admit to criminal insanity now when do i start the cure
dont you see how silly youre being
no comment
and thats where youre not being clever he wouldnt parade his crime in front of the open shades
thats where hes being clever acting nonchalant
jeff do you think a murderer would let you see all that that he shouldnt keep his shades down and hide behind them
yeah
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up and walked along the corridor and the streets and the backyard
what are you getting at
you could see all the things he did couldnt you
its pretty hard to stay away from that word isnt is
maybe hes leaving his wife i dont know and i dont care lots of people have saws knives and ropes around their houses lots of men dont speak to their wives all day lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts but very very very few of them end up in murder if thats what youre thinking
there is ive seen things through that window bickering family fights mysterious trips at night knives saws rope and since last evening not a sight or sound of his wife now you tell me where she is and what shes doing
theres nothing to see
lisa please
she could be under sedatives sleeping hes in the room now
wheres the doctor the undertakers
maybe she died
a lot of things shes an invalid who needs constant care and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day
what makes you think somethings wrong with her
i want to find out whats wrong with the salesmans wife does that make me sound like a madman
what is it youre looking for
youd better before you catch the disease
i dont know what you consider it but if you dont stop it im getting out of here
do you think i consider this recreation
sitting around looking out a window to kill time is one thing but doing it the way you are with with binoculars and with wild opinions about every little movement you see is is diseased
now lisa
jeff if you could only see yourself
something too frightful to utter
what do you think
lisa theres something terribly wrong
i wouldnt dare answer that
why hasnt he gone into his wifes bedroom all day
nothing thank heaven
whats interesting about a butchers knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper
homework its more interesting
not that salesmans wife and why didnt he go to work today
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home
why would a man leave his apartment three times on a rainy night with a suitcase and come back three times
tell me about it
so do i
i have one now
dont you ever have any problems
your mind is and when i want a man i want all of him
im not exactly on the other side of the room
without any future
cant we just sort of keep things status quo
i mean what i said
you mean goodnight
not quite it seems goodbye jeff
theres nothing wrong with you lisa you have the town in the palm of your hand
and its deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it is to take out a subscription to your magazine i guess im not the girl i thought i was
right now it doesnt seem so
you dont think either one of us could ever change
if anything im making it sound good lets face it lisa you arent made for that kind of a life few people are
jeff you dont have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me im wrong
huh try and find a raincoat in brazil even when it isnt raining lisa on this job you carry one suitcase your home is the available transportation you sleep rarely bathe even less and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive
well theyd be very stylish in finland just before you froze to death begin to get the idea
three
those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle and those nylons and sixounce lingerie
ever get shot at run over sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera
oh i do that all the time whenever i have a few minutes after lunch
you might have to if you went with me ever try to keep warm in a c at fifteen thousand feet at twenty below zero
of course not
did you ever eat fish heads and rice
lisa shut up
you cant fit in here i cant fit in there according to you people should be born live an die on the same
lisa simmer down will you
its ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special private little group of anointed people
all right thats your opinion youre entitled to it but
what is it but traveling from one place to another taking pictures its just like being a tourist on an endless vacation
some people can now if youll let me explain
it doesnt make sense to me whats so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person couldnt live in both places just as easily
theres nothing im hiding its just that
if youre saying all this just because you dont want to tell me the truth because youre hiding something from me then maybe i can understand
no wonder hes having so much trouble with it
almost as if it were being written especially for us
i think its enchanting
oh some songwriter in the studio apartment lives alone probably had an unhappy marriage
you said it resembled my apartment didnt you
how can you tell that from here
shes not in love with him or any of them
well she picked the most prosperous looking one
not exactly but we have a little apartment here thats probably about as popular as yours you of course remember miss torso
oh you can see my apartment all the way up on rd street
miss lonely hearts at least thats something youll never have to worry about
thats what is know as manless melancholia
lets not talk any more nonsense huh
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit
thats what im afraid of could you see me driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep wearing combat boots and a three day beard
dont laugh i could do it
for yourself and me i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow fashion portraits
for what
yes
you mean leave the magazine
make the one you want
i wish there was one i wanted
jeff isnt it time you came home you could pick your assignment
how could i run it from say pakistan
someday you might want to open up your own studio here
thats good news
you cant buy that kind of publicity
she looked very cool she had on a mint green
tell me what was slim hayward wearing
not a bit i was all morning in a sales meeting then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with madame dufresne just over from paris with some spy reports back to the for lunch with the harpers bazaar people thats when i ordered dinner then two fall showings twenty blocks apart then i had to have a cocktail with leland and slim hayward were trying to get his next show then i had to dash back and change
tired
what a day ive had
well im going to make this a week youll never forget
yeah i want to get this thing off and get moving
i couldnt think of anything more boring and tiresome than what youve been through and the last week must be the hardest
fine corkscrews on the right
big enough
you have perhaps an ambulance outside
what would you think of starting off with dinner at the
i wanted to jeff oh
now thats no way to spend your hard earned money
its cracked and you never use it and its too ornate im sending up a plain flat silver one with just your initials engraved
picked it up in shanghai which has also seen better days
hasnt been any big demand for tickets
its opening night of the last depressing week of l b jefferies in a cast
its just a runofthemill monday the calendars loaded with them
going on right here its a big night
something big going on somewhere
who buys them tax collectors
we sell a dozen a day in this price range
that dress should be listed on the stock exchange
a steal at eleven hundred dollars
depends on the quote lets see theres the plane tickets over import duties hidden taxes profit markups
only because its expected of her
the lisa fremont who never wears the same dress twice

i wouldnt know did you ask her
whats she doin runnin around the country at night
nobody the light was bad
who shot who
like you said maybe he knows where my ranch is if he does hell be waiting on the porch
and thats more important than finding lednov
ive got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed
were going to look for him want to come along
maybe he did
you should be maybe lednov heard about that sonora ranch of yours
grahams got something to tell you might interest you
hello graham joe mr gardner
why didnt you say so go right out and get her ed build the fire up
and one of em is sick
it doesnt matter who they are

tell them to come on in
maybe you wont feel that way after i tell you what i stopped in for
you dont know how good it is to see you
i havent got the job yet
because well you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there tonight i was sort of tied up with steve but tomorrow i figured on doing just that
why
that job you were talkin about did you get it yet
to the other side of the street
where you going
like i said women get in the way sometimes
thanks for loading me on the stage i know now why you did it
thanks for taking over
by the way if you ever go past the wyatt ranch have another talk with elaine
goodbye mary
goodbye thanks for the lift
maybe they will
im fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will somebody who wants me as i am will maybe walk into the place where im working and take me out of there
hurry up
i cant change either not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand
i cant help how i think youre trained a certain way when youre a kid and you cant change
some of em you didnt mean but most of em you did i dont blame you because i understand your way of thinking and why you think that way you want your women on pedestals but they have to be born on em they can fall off but they cant climb back up
fine maybe ill see you there sometime
its going to sonora
maybe it isnt going to sonora but its going somewhere which is all right with me
im sorry
i wont have you fighting over me
like i said i was thinkin of the horses
if you want to go on i can make it all right
so grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance
there wont be any rest of the trip over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along so keep your money youll need it for the fare im fed up with you i was fed up with you before we started
go on take it then you cant spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid
thats right worry about your clothes
all my clothes
i suppose thats my fault
no im not all right im soaked and i hit myself against that rock
then lets get started the sooner i get to sonora the better ill like it
all right its said
save em for the girl in gingham just tell me im not good enough for you go on say a woman like me cant change
if its pretty speeches you want you wont be hearing them even when i mean em they dont come easy
im awake now go on say what you want to say ill listen
i dont expect anything a minute ago i hadnt cuite waked up
what did you expect speeches i dont mean
what does a man usually tell a girl
what
tell me darling
you dont mean that clay
maybe its better that way
you should have i dont like leaving things unfinished
yes but that was the other night now i dont think i would
you wouldnt do a thing like that would you
so thats it you think i was making fun of your girl in gingham
you know so much about me figure it out
oh it did it had a great deal to do with you
i dont know i thought i did now im not sure i thought it had something to do with me
why do you think
why did you change your mind about bringing us along
not on this trail i dont ive been over it before anyway you ought to be pretty sleepy why dont you climb in back
dont you trust me
no im not all i want em to do is keep ahead of us a long way ahead so im riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail
youre not going out to look for them
better go on back and get some more sleep youll need it later on
its too light yet
are we leaving
thats fine
he knows his alphabet
blonde as a new mop and beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar
will she be dark or fair
but the rest is right
ill make the soap myself
she wears this gingham dress cooks popovers makes jam in season makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples
go on tell me more about her
ever since youve looked after steve youve had the dream a ranch on the river good grass good water barn corral and house that part youve shared with steve the girl in gingham you plan sneakin in when he isnt looking
you should know shes in your dream
the who
youve earned it the horse ranch on the toulomoe the girl in the spotted gingham
thanks
i hope you get everything you want out of life
you could have treated us like they did in aspen no you wouldnt do a thing like that it isnt in you to be mean or cruel
i couldnt leave you sitting by the road
you dont have to explain did i tell you how grateful i am for what youve done
and its not only because the trips a tough one
i suppose it is
im sorry but thats how its got to be
i hope so too
no thanks i hope we wont be a burden to them
coffee
its a long walk back to aspen
we cant stay here
hold on
i didnt know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded i couldnt leave her in the street lets go
didnt you know she had a father and mother out here
so that was why she tried to run away
no maam we cant we can get a roof and a fire and maybe mrs wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people
can we get a doctor at that ranch
but the nearest shelters the wyatt ranch and thats maybe five hours away
his letters will keep
theyre stragglin
are the horses stragglin or arent they
learnin to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street
yeah while the horses wander all over the country
hes learning his letters
get back to the horses theyre straggling
like sticking his nose into other peoples business
like what
that why you always took him on the other side of the street
yeah
theres a nice boy
go on theres a good boy
would you mr phillips
steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire
im not in his shoes so leave me out of it
if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home
and look at it this way how about jim it puts him in a sort of tough spot
of course itll work you can get another girl to fill out the act
in the grub box toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground wont be so hard
where do you keep the can opener
mostly we open a can of beans and boil some coffee
but you eat dont you
steve and me we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp
thanks and isnt there something we can do about supper or making the beds
its a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt
so am i
im clay phillips my brother steve
and this is helen carter
too much excitement or maybe its just the heat how about the surrey can you fix it
whats the matter with her
youll have to drive except down hill
our kind of women
im not running a stage line maam and i cant take a chance on losing the horses
we have to get to sonora there are jobs waiting for us there well pay you for your trouble
you can stay here if you like
what good is it going to do us to go to some ranch
course i cant ill give you a lift to the first ranch
you cant leave us here
did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over sonora pass its quite a job
they wont be riding in the wagon
just about
as far as sonora
yes maam
im clay phillips my brother steve
and this is helen carter
it was a gift from the citizens of aspen im mary wells
this must have been in the family a long time
too much excitement how about the surrey can you fix it
whats the matter with her
no we came down the hill a little fast and the wheel broke can you fix it for us
anybody hurt
hello miss wells
heres a man says hes looking for you girls
shes a friend took off this morning sort of sudden while i wasnt around
so did i they were in it
i found their surrey
a fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden he dont take chances my names clayton and im looking for someone
then dont come sneakin around a mans camp
drop yours im gunshy
no they wont
youve got to dont you understand they want me with them and theyll fix it so i have to go
i cant
hows that
which ranch
stretch out under the seat miss
it wouldnt happen to be this
i lost something
well then i know it takes three four weeks for you to come round to admit when youre wrong but by that time shes liable to be in china
i guess so but dont make a habit of it
so maybe im old enough to tell you how to run your life
yeah but dont make a habit of it
guess maybe im old enough to hold my own in a fight huh
youll live
kind of sore
hows that
i just wondered lets go
sure what other reason would there be
is that the only reason you came back
like i told you half those horses are mine im makin sure they get to the ranch safe so lets quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin
what did you come back for
youll get your share go on i dont want you around
half of them are mine
you want to split up
it is so your fault and and i guess maybe when we hit the ranch you andme better
she told me not to fight with you anymore she said it wasnt your fault but i figure different
i dont care what she asked you
you know what she asked me
you think youre so slmighty smart who are you to sit up there and say nobodys good enough for you like you said yesterday just because a man kisses a woman
i said keep your nose out of my life no kid is going to tell me how to run it
maybe i havent lived as long as you have but i know a sight more about people and i wouldnt talk to a mule like you talked to her and if i did id say how sorry i was id be man enough to do that
you keep your nose out of my life young fella
you oughta say youre sorry thats what you oughta do
sit down and eat till i say the word youre doing what youre told
go on hit me
what makes you think youre so almighty telling people what to do and how to act when you dont even know how yourself
kind of feeling your oats this morning i havent laid a hand on you for quite a while but that doesnt mean youre too old
ill eat when im good and ready
come on we got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep
that aint why i just figure its about time to start runnin my own life
all right i hurt your feelings but you know better than to go lightin fires
you better start
i didnt stop to think clay
just the grub box and bed rolls
want the wagon unloaded clay
theres a lot of things i dont see any sense to but make up your mind learn to read or go back and watch the horses
im not but theres some of it i dont see any sense to
dont go arguing with your teacher
theres only two of them now
finished son
leaving them here when we could just as well take them we got plenty of room in the wagon and and they cook and drive the mules they dont bother anybody
but you never can tell why dont you get that new rifle out of the wagon
yeah it does
maybe i should but i was never much on killin anyway he moved too quick and i just got him through the shoulder looks pretty peaceful up ahead
maybe you shoulda killed him
i caught up with lednov in nogales he didnt like the idea of comin back across the border but he came i turned him over to the sheriff and thats the story
oh thats the time you went away
thats what i told you then only he didnt lednov killed him
sure i do went off down to mexico or something
you remember jeff rawson we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high
sure i remember you went to mexico lookin for cattle
i guess i have you were pretty little when they locked him up i dont suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months
okeh i was wrong but you cant expect a fellow who never saw lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin youve been sorta close mouthed about him
i wont again
its all right with me if she teaches you but i dont want you forgettin your job
sure youll find it under the wagon seat like i said before a twenty twos more your size
can i have my gun back
thats right steve
a man cant help gettin excited once in a while
good thing you didnt
they were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin i didnt have them to aim
howd you happen to miss
there was only three of them at first i guess i lost my head
swimming
whered they go
morgan blood the beat in nevada clay and me have a place on the toulomne river were going to raise horses like these
ive got eleven horses
things get tough next winter youll have somethin to wear
they sure must have been travelin this keeps up we can start a store
lednov
he doesnt like me what you eatin
why
yeah and lednovs only lookin for one man me
sure a lot of guys lookin for lednov
unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up
and meet him there
thats lednov we come along here
all right ill tell you
do you have to be so closemouthed im your brother and im ridin with you remember
maybe at the ranch maybe sooner than that
at the ranch maybe
yes
you must be plenty worried about lednov sneakin up on us think he will
this is an awful nice gun certainly come in handy when theres men around who shoot people that arent lookin
the other fellow wasnt even lookin
in a fight
you sure worry that bone he killed a fellow
what was he in jail for
the thing to do is stick to rabbits
but its leaded up and anyway a s no good for real huntin you shoot a man with a and where are you
nice
no call to that jail looked pretty solid to me hows she feel
you never said this lednovs name before that i can remember
i dont want to run short
like why youre buyin a whole slew of shells all of a sudden
like what
you might tell a fellow things specially if the fellows your brother seems to me
a man i used to know
whos lednov
i dont see no sense to makin people leave town if they dont want to leave
thats right
a little hot
how does she draw
whats there to be fair about
youre not bein quite fair
nobody asked you to
i cant take her with me
all right you didnt know
im sorry about this mr wyatt i didnt know you had a daughter
whats there to be fair about
youre not bein quite fair
nobody asked you to
i cant take her with me
all right you didnt know
im sorry about this mr wyatt i didnt know who she was
the whole states lookin for em and theyre lookin for me
yeah how did you know
three men on matched roans
you can light the lamp im sure glad its you we were afraid those killers might come back
thats a good girl
im sorry lets go
dont act so crazy
dont ask me because i wont tell you i wont tell anybody go away
runnin off and worryin people makin it tougher on clay than it is already
whats botherin you anyway
i said i didnt care
suppose that lednov was to have found you instead of me why you wouldnt have had a chance
i dont care
you cant stay here theres snakes and its cold and youll just get sicker
if you need me ill be
goodnight miss wells
goodnight
steve
you dont know what it is to be sorry
thanks steve
you stretch out ill fix something to eat
its a long ways yet i figure we ought to camp shes tired
for the last ten miles ive been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up im getting to the point where i dont think theres any place named sonora
let me do that
oh sure
she was only teasin
hell treat his wife just as good maybe better ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers
but youre his brother
dont pay any attention to him thats his way and ive found hes sure easy to get along with i dont recollect him havin hit me moren a couple of times and i guess i had it comin
i was doin both here
you were supposed to be reading words
like when you were standin there looking after clay i knew right off what you were thinking because ive been watching you
sure
and youve got me all figured out
sometimes not knowin how to read has its points you cant read books so you look at people and figure em out
oh i wasnt worrying i saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave
nobodys gonna catch him sleeping dont worry about him
now i know what a unicorn is what do we do next
well steve
i feel good anyways
you dont read to fill your stomach poetry for instance all the poems in the world wouldnt fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal but they make you feel good
an if you cant hunt em and even if you could theyd be tough whats the use of knowin how to spell them
then if they wasnt alive how can they be an animal
kind of tough i guess but youre not liable to hunt them i dont think theres any alive now anyways and im not sure but i dont think there ever were
would they be good to eat
how about california
no
horses with horns huh do we have em in nevada
hmmm sort of like a horse with a horn in the center of its forehead
what do they look like
unicorn a kind of animal
unicorn what in hecks that
theres plenty of use for reading youll see
and even if i do learn to read what usell it be im goin to live on a ranch
without someone to teach you its tough
and thats tough isnt it
from a to z all you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words
then i know my alphabet
thats the end of the line
what comes after z
no were not stayin
arent we stayin
okay abc def ghi
dont be silly nobodys too old to learn
im too old for it miss wells thats for little kids
why not you went farther than that last time
gee i cant
good night steve
good night miss wells
oh no nobody said nothing to me only i got the idea that well clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window i could see you dancing but clay always took me over to the other side of the street
did someone say i wasnt nice
youre so nice
thatd be swell you know youre an awful lot different than i thought youd be
maybe i could start you out
i sure would
would you like to learn them
dont you even know your letters
it wasnt clays fault weve been moving around most all the time mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place i can learn my letters then
but he just never troubled to have you get any schooling
since i can remember maam
your brothers always looked after you hasnt he
i cant read maam i just look at the pictures
is that your kind of reading steve
i was at first then i was hanging on are you going far
pleased to meet you maam we found your trunk were you doin the driven
doctor derek sommersby you mean from one life to live
hang on did you ever know a derek sommersby

its all in the wrist you know you look really familiar you from around here whered you go to high school
nice technique there cammi
bye
i love you
bye
listen ill call you when we get there and we can talk about it then okay
i ask you one simple question and suddenly im attacking you
i dont know christine perhaps its because i feel attacked
why are you being so defensive
honey im just saying you know i need a little space before the wedding isnt that the point of this isnt that what we talked about with dr gertler
im not going to call every five minutes but this is important
i didnt dismiss you i told you what i thought but it didnt seem to matter so you decide besides this is supposed to be my time with miles i hope youre not going to call every five minutes
dont dismiss me im trying to include you in this decision hes your friend
then put him with the feldmans whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me
the problem with that is that then theres one extra
well then put him at the singles table
really because i dont know i was thinking that
just seeing how youre doing and um mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again and were wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans or should he be at one of the singles tables
so whats up
good thats good
yeah all twenty minutes so far have been a blast
you guys having fun
its christine hey you
itll just take a second
dont bother him with that we got to get going
youre a wonderful writer miles dont be discouraged
so i guess thats it
im sorry miles we did all we could youve been a real trooper tell him ill call back
yeah im here
are you there miles
im sorry miles so i dont know where that leaves us im not sure how much more mileage i can get out of continuing to submit it i think its one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now a fabulous book with no home the whole industrys gotten gutless its not about the quality of the books its about the marketing
huh

oooh oh miles miles
have you no shame
she probably went home lit some candles put on some relaxing music took a nice hot bath and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator
shut up
single waitress getting off work looking for love a little slap and tickle
no rock when she came to the bar sans rock
how do you know
somebody had to do the talking and by the way i was right shes not married
didnt seem to me like thats what was going on you were all over her
im trying to get you some action but youve got to help me out just a little bit
now ive got another lie to live down thanks jack
the chick digs you she lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published
well im tired arent you tired
the girl is looking to party and you tell her were going to go back to our motel room and crash jesus miles
youre blind dude blind
she works for tips
why do you always focus on the negative didnt you see how friendly she was to you
jack shes a fucking waitress in buellton how would that ever work
perfect
and she likes pinot
ooooooohh now were getting somewhere
well she does know a lot about wine
jesus shes jammin and she likes you what else do you know about her
you dont know anything about this woman calm down lets just eat okay the duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the highliner pinot
so whats a professors wife doing waitressing obviously thats over
this gals married to i think a philosophy professor at uc santa barbara
doesnt mean shit when christine was a hostess at sushi roku she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her think it worked fuck no how do you think i met her
and very nice and very married check out the rock
she is very hot
jack this is where i eat when i come up here its practically my office and sometimes i have a drink with the employees mayas great shes worked here about a year maybe a year and a half
you know that chick
sure i know maya
you know her
oh yeah thats maya
its going to be great heres to us
heres to my last week of freedom
pour us a couple
yeah tight
yeah its good feels good
then its a good thing
it does feels right
if thats what feels right
were not getting any younger right and my career well its gotten pretty you know frustrating even with my new manager maybe its time to settle down
uhhuh
no way this would just provide some stability is what im saying i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there you know keep myself in the game in case something big comes along
so youre going to stop acting
christines dad hes been talking about bringing me into his property business showing me the ropes and thats something considering how long it took him to get over im not armenian so im thinking about it but i dont know might get a little incestuous but mike does pretty well a lot of highend commercial stuff
well you waited for good reason and you proposed to christine for some good reason so i think its great its time youve got to have your eyes open thats all i mean look at me i thought victoria and i were set for life
come on do you think im doing the right thing tell the truth youve been through it
whoa
you think im making a mistake marrying christine
not with the wine list these people have we dont want to hold back
we should have driven
its not even a mile
i thought you said it was close now im all pitted out
just a minute
hey jack hurry up
want some
are you chewing gum
yeah that would be a good move
you know you could work in a wine store
usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities but this ones pretty damn good this is the new one right chris
how would you rate this one
now
when do we get to drink it
thats what you do with every one
now set your glass down and get some air into it
huh maybe a little strawberry yeah strawberry im not so sure about the cheese
i dont know wine fermented grapes
what do you smell
now tip it what youre doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim tells you how old it is among other things usually more important with reds this is a very young wine so its going to retain its color pretty solidly now stick your nose in it
huh
depends on the varietal just get a sense of it thick thin watery syrupy inky amber whatever
what color is it supposed to be
first take your glass and examine the wine against the light youre looking at color and clarity
pinot noir not again you know not all pinots are noir
good yeah it is a rose only this one is rather atypically made from pinot noir
this is rose right
now were talking
baked with a butterlime glaze
i owe her a call anyway
doesnt have to be now lets go taste
let me call christine
oh jesus look at some point we have to find out because its going to make a big difference
i dont know salmon dont you always have white wine with fish
yeah but how are they making the salmon poached with a yogurtdill sauce teriyaki curry
i told you filet and salmon
so whatd you guys finally decide on for the menu
thanks jack so do i here we are
hey miles i really hope your novel sells
i like all varietals i just dont generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation
i thought you hated chardonnay
these guys make topnotch pinot and chardonnay one of the best producers in santa barbara county look how beautiful this view is what a day
whatevers closest man i need a glass
you know what lets take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first
and get your bone smooched
jack this week is not about me its about you im going to show you a good time were going to drink a lot of good wine play some golf eat some great food enjoy the scenery and send you off in style
well i say fuck that you need to get your joint worked on thats what you need
and lexapro yes
well i say fuck therapy and whats that stuff you take xanax
i went on monday but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer
you still seeing that shrink
im working on it
no no youve been officially depressed for like two years now and you were always a negative guy anyway even in college now its worse youre wasting away teaching english to fucking eighthgraders when they should be reading what you wrote your books
id rather have a knife
itd be the best thing for you you know what im going to get you laid this week thats going to be my best man gift to you im not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit
its not worth it you pay too big a price its never free
speak for yourself i get chicks looking at me all the time all ages
as if shed even be attracted to guys like us in the first place
thats your problem miles
shes a kid jack i dont even look at that stuff anymore
fuck man too early in the morning for that you know what i mean
and miles is my best man mrs raymond my main man
this saturday mom remember we told you
just a second guys going for
let me show you something the secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released you keep pressure on it so you dont
thats a good age
um seventy something
how olds she going to be
its her birthday tomorrow and i dont feel right driving by her house and not stopping in okay itll just take a second shes right off the freeway
your mother jesus miles we were supposed to be up there hours ago
i thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother
what
ive just got to make one quick stop wont take a second
whoa why are we getting off
well then i guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different
there is no new ending page on is exactly the same
oh yeah much better
how about the new ending did you like that
i liked it a lot a lot of improvements it just seemed overall i dont know tighter more congealed or something
and
oh yeah yeah
did you read the latest draft by the way
sure is tasty
color in the red wines comes from the skins this juice is free run so theres no skin contact in the fermentation ergo no color
just tell me
jesus dont ask questions like that up in the wine country theyll think youre a moron
pinot noir how come its white doesnt noir mean dark
pinot noir single vineyard they dont even make it anymore
oh thats tasty

and i havent been with anyone since my divorce this has been a big deal for me maya hanging out with you and last night i really like you maya and im not jack im just his his freshman roommate from san diego state
you know i just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception and ive been doing just fine
yeah
oh maya no
but you wanted to fuck me first
please believe me i was even on the verge of telling you last night but
im sure he believed every word
oh just that he loves her that shes the only woman who has ever really rocked his world how he adores siena how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to
hes an actor so it cant be good
do you know what hes been saying to her
ive told him ive told him over and over but hes out of control
dont touch me just take me home
maya
of course i was i mean just now i could have made up some story but i didnt i told you the truth
were you ever going to say anything
what rehearsal dinner
no weve got to get back friday for the rehearsal dinner
did you hear about this bordeaux tasting dinner down in santa barbara saturday night its a little pricey but if you wanted to go id be into it why dont you stay through the weekend
okay
about twothirty
great whats the latest we can get there
you guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today
you too
well nice to see you now
i had class
oh yeah no i mean yeah i stopped by for a drink didnt see you
hey miles i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me
goodnight miles
hope you like it feel free to stop reading at any time ill take no offense
oh yeah sure of course
um did you still want to read my novel
okay see you around
good so did i
i had a good time tonight miles i really did
got it
you know how to get back to the windmill right
yeah
bathroom over there
like what a fraud he was
yeah like what
i suppose i got really into wine originally through my exhusband he had a big kind of showoff cellar but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate and the more i drank the more i liked what it made me think about
i dont know why are you into wine
what about me
i mean cabernets can be powerful and exalting but they seem prosaic to me for some reason by comparison how about you
why are you so into pinot its like a thing with you
sure
can i ask you a personal question
my palates kind of shot but from what i can tell id dub it pretty damn good
oh yeah who cares im the queen of typos wow this is really starting to open up what do you think
i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car its not fully proofed but if youre okay with a few typos
well
so you want to work for a winery or something someday
i commute to san luis obispo twice a week
horticulture wow i didnt know there was a college here
yeah im working on a masters in horticulture chipping away at it
a paper
like me i have this stupid paper due on friday and as usual im freaked out about it just like in high school it never changes
yeah thanks
wow anyway i think its amazing youre getting it published really i know how hard it is just to write it even
mrnmm yeah but not really it shifts around a lot like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father and some other stuff happens some parallel narrative and then it evolves or devolves into a kind of a robbegrillet mystery you know with no real resolution
so is it kind of about death and mortality or
um yeah but its more
oh you mean today
the day after yesterday
whats the title
well its a little difficult to summarize it begins as a firstperson account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke kind of based on personal experience but only loosely
so whats your novel about
yeah definitely
yeah weird but great
yeah i know its kind of weird out of context
its kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanies house all those times you came into the restaurant its like youre a real person now almost
yeah same here
who me nah id just fuck them up that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce no kids
you got kids
shes with her grandmother shes with stephs mom she spends a lot of time over there stephs well shes stephanie
is she sleeping or
yeah sienas a sweetie
is this stephanies kid sure is cute
yeah id say youre right on the money
i think they overdid it a bit too much alcohol overwhelms the fruit
wow we gotta give it a moment but this is tasty really good how about you
eightyeight sassicaia

what im saying is dont trust anyone find yourself a weapon of some sort
it can ordinary matter like ours not affected everything else disintegrates
can it work
youre being tricked sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors hes figured out theyre made of subatomic particles called neutrinos and hes going to create a negative neutrino field twenty four hours a day until theyre back on earth
what do you want
you think youre dreaming me like you dream her understand something i am the real gibarian just a new incarnation
leave the light off
gibarian

how quickly
its changing characteristics its solidifying taking on weight
whose side are you on

in the lab with her probably
wheres his body
the same thing that could happen to any of us
i am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation now what happened to him
who here could possibly care what you want at best youre employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction they have no idea whats going on up here theyve never even been in space and im supposed to listen to you
i want to hear your version
didnt you talk to snow

i love her
youll see her die thats all theyre mortal despite what she told you she will die then what will you do
into what
who are you trying to please yourself her which her this one or that one can you face both we are in a situation that is beyond morality so leave with her youll see the transformation
maybe she doesnt need any should we check
her oxygen would have run out
kelvin shell disintegrate you dont believe me lets radio that shuttle pod you launched better yet lets go get it ive charted its trajectory only take a few hours

no
she knows everything does she know she came once before and you put her in
she knows everything she knows who she is
oh this one you love what about the first one the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space you didnt love her
get out
why do you think she hasnt suggested that its the most obvious solution escape she knows she cant leave here
she drank liquid oxygen
what happened
thats right and we all have to sleep eventually
they come when you sleep
but they are human they certainly become human with incredible speed first theyre like they were in our memory but then they fill in on their own dna doesnt determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain its not dense enough they build up with experience
human beings can die
perhaps it did
but why is it doing what its doing given its resources it could have done anything presented me with your double and you with mine
well i think were reaching the point of diminishing returns here right certainly its learning more about us than well ever learn about it
ive never heard you express any desire to leave before now why now
of course when we return well be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth well chalk it up to isolation collective derangement
no
we can liquidate the station take the athena back
who are you trying to convince
consciousness is enough thats all ive saying consciousness should be enough for anybody
stop equivocating unbelievable how you equivocate you the atheist youre more dogmatic than any holy person ive ever seen this is happening kelvin wake up
not necessarily
if god is beyond our comprehension and she is here for reasons that cant be understood isnt god here
we are not sure of that we are not sure we arent all hallucinating
youre unnerved because youve spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you and suddenly your subconscious is an open book we are for the first time experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own that proves that
when you cut yourself pounding the door did it hurt
im just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances
is it being deliberately cruel you mean i dont think so
just a little strategy session but in person this time
why
can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour
what is it
kelvin you awake
thats ludicrous this is contact we have found god the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth so how will we describe it if we choose to describe it at all
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project we are in little danger of being left alone for long youll need to do something otherwise theyll be sending someone out to recover you
i dont know
what are you going to report back to earth
to who
what will you say
told you what
i wish youd told me
probably
will she come back
it started about three months ago right after the government sold the expedition we were ready to go home
rheya
she has materialized from your memory of her what was her name
dead
my wife
im not sure it started with gibarian he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door he covered the video lens obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown i dont know why he didnt tell us he had somebody in there by this time we were getting visitors too he was desperately trying to figure it out day and night who was she
and professionally
personally i think its god at least it fits my definition
what was it
i told you try to stay calm youre supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch
shut up
was her breakfast conversation that bad
well when you do go to sleep barricade your door
that depends
how long can you go without sleep
how much sleep
how much sleep do you need
oh thats a relief
tell me i wont think youre insane
she was real where did she come from
who was it
gibarian warned me he left me a message
why who did you see
is there anybody else here
kelvin if you see anything unusual
hell let me in
in his lab he wont let you in
wheres sartorius
i cant talk just now im too tired
i love chocolate i realized just yesterday how much i love it i thought maybe if they let you bring personal effects you might have snuck some through because well ive been thinking about it
what
you didnt bring any chocolate did you
how
hes dead
whats wrong what happened to gibarian
shhhh just stay with me stay with me everything is forgiven everything
how can you be here
you must have been dreaming
last night you were talking to someone in the corridor
when
where did you go before
please dont
ive decided that if it is god its a sick god its ambitions exceed its powers but it doesnt realize it its created a situation without a goal and i hate that a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purpose and us we would have to have an arrangement an unspoken understanding that i am not human how can i not hate something that does that
i dont know something anything
what does it want
a sleeping pill do you want yours
what are you taking
i dont know anymore all i see is you
am i really her
it put you here ill admit it it acted like a god and put you here put you into my consciousness i was asleep and it put you into my dream i saw your mouth and there you were whether youve been sent here to make me happy or punish me it doesnt matter the decision we make now is all that matters stay with me
i cant
you have to remember that i love you thats all that matters
i have consciousness but i am not mortal dont you see why im going crazy
i think they help
they do something to me its hard to think straight
i wish you wouldnt
i want to stop taking those pills
is that really what you want
but then i would be dead now
yes i told you it was exactly like mine
did you hear what gibarian said im not a human being im an instrument i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what even if i remain passive thats when i drank the i was going mad it felt like there was no body underneath my skin there was something else an illusion but i could feel my heart beating and i remembered you tested my blood is it like yours
yes you are
i i am rheya but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago
who are you then
thats impossible im not rheya
you exist here i keep telling you
youre lying
i want you here
what do i have to do to stop it
then you wont make it
chris please chris im serious i wont make it
i cant stay here
chris
i never said i didnt
you never said you wanted one
neither did i
chris i had to i had to i didnt think youd react like this
thank you
it wouldnt have made any difference
you should have told me
dont do this i am literally begging you not to do this chris
i want every second i can get with you
then youll die
rheya i am not going back im staying here with you
youre lying im not human
no
im disgusting
listen i dont care about anything but the fact that you are here you are her you are rheya
dont call me that
rheya
im not rheya youve always known that
i dont think it knows its torturing us its just watching
how could it be so cruel how could it torture us like this
how can i tell youve seen both of me i only know what youre like here youre all i know there is no you from before
that wont happen again were different
dont im the one at risk here if were playing out what happened before i wont survive
i love you
please dont lie i told you before i dont know how i came to be here whatever you think you cant say to me i need to hear you say it
its all right
whats happening to us
he is but he was here
you said he was dead
gibarian he was here
whats wrong
if youre here
do you
do you want to stay here
not this time
but thats what happened before
neither can i not any of it theres no reference point for whats going on its never happened before its a clean break in the fabric of the universe a gap there is nothing to do but experience it momentto moment and not let it destroy us
i have these strange thoughts i dont know where they come from i cant explain it
for a reason that neither of us understand you are forced to stay near me thats all i know right now
thats what you were saying i heard what you were saying
rheya
you dont want me
im just as human as you i see i hear i touch and i feel just like you do
dont debate him hell say anything
youre the coward
those are dreams
i dont think do its not sleep its something else its all around me
can you sleep
i love you too
no i love you
was she right
you she said i didnt love her
why did she do it
yes especially toward the end
but we fought
im just trying to understand whats going on
im sure there are worse people to talk to but i dont know who they are
when when im asleep
sartorius
who have you been talking to
that i am not rheya that rheya died killed herself im different
what are you talking about
stop
you dont love me
whats wrong
im glad
yes yes
do i really feel like i am
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me
its a violent response to something we havent figured out dont let the cowardly demeanor fool you he is ruthless unblinking in his prejudice
you feel sorry for solaris or for me
he does have a point thats just not the way id like to see it proven
he has a point
well he doesnt think its god but for different reasons than me hes thinking if i can figure out how to make it stop than i am smarter than it is and therefore it cannot be god
sartorius wants to destroy it
snow thinks we shouldnt leave until we figure out a way to document it to prove its existence to the planet earth this is hilarious he thinks its god but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home
what does snow think you should do
i know im putting that in my next report
you sure say god a lot when were doing it
you know ive decided im just gonna believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing itll make life so much easier the little wife agreeing with her big strong husband you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day
how could she not be real i can smell her taste her she does exactly what she did its not possible
i like that too
good because i want you to know i really like fucking you
i think so
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you
its genetics you know this you know where it comes from there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires
i cant help feeling that im cheating when i take them
i dont know i couldnt understand why you didnt tell me
why did you say those things
you dont know
what happened to us exactly
i did too
thinking what you were doing and saying just being consumed by thinking of you i loved it so much that feeling
i know i know we dont have to talk about that
scared no not scared wary like i was something to be her guard went up i was a threat now i know why she was afraid shed be seen that i would see her for the selfobsessed neurotic that she was i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal but thats the cycle right i knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on i guess thats part of the reason why
what kind of look
seven eight so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what im doing and i start trying to explain to her about this state that i can put myself in and this look comes over her face
how old were you
i would have these i dont know how to describe them visions when i was younger maybe not visions but like these waking dream states time would just collapse i would be inside time i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped freaky stuff
i been thinking about how much i hate you
whereve you been
when i saw you were gone i got scared
you were trying to break down the door do you know why
what happened
as i said then its god right
as i said it is beyond our comprehension
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang
youre talking about a man in a white beard again youre ascribing human characteristics to something that isnt human human beings look for causes and patterns how could we know what solaris is up to if anything
even a god that wasnt active that just created something and stood back and watched
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man even the limits we put on it are human limits it can do this it can do that it designs it creates
you still dont believe in god
its something
then its god right
intelligent beyond our comprehension
is it intelligent
not exactly it exists in a continuum that wasnt proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe an infinite number of them in fact it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe space or spacetime it was completely counterintuitive we had to unlearn everything
is it a planet
yes but not until you mentioned them as soon as you said those things i remembered them and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember its like filling up
do you remember beethoven the beatles movies books restaurants friends
what do you mean
what do you remember
all right how about i feel better when you take them
i know i know but still somehow i dont feel better
youre better when you take them
you talk like an actor
i am please come with me i dont want to do this here
you go home
lets go home
and i just want to know if im crazy or not if what i think is happening is actually happening or am i one of those people those women who are blind to whats going on who pretend not to see their husbands attention toward another woman
rheya not here
you behave as though you want to fuck her
stop it
you want to fuck her
better
and tonight
i wasnt
you didnt look very happy
not a very happy poem
my thomas is a little rusty
poem dylan thomas i thought of it when i saw you on the train
book
and death shall have no dominion
i want you inside me right now
rheya
yes

to calm my anxiety
to calm your anxiety
what are they

fuck me i knew it
i got rid of him i wanted to see if i wanted to be the only one i wanted to be snow
im not snow
snow get up here now
gibarian was helpless its very simple man created the science that resulted in the discovery of solaris and the ship that brought us here
gibarian was under enormous
are the actions of solaris premeditated
followed by nonhuman manifestations
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the original the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness
a recoil with no compensating mechanism
its an experiment
they are not autonomous individuals and theyre not actual persons they are projections materializing from our minds based on a given individual
we want to talk freely
we thought youd be alone we want to talk about
he wont
why do you say that
he wont do it
you take care

i heard
theyre operating on him hes still alive
if she identifies him where the fuck were you anyway cowboy venza was meat he walked right past you and now were the ones playing catchup you better hope she identifies him
what about when she identifies him
hes got a good lawyer and he made a smart move weve got a scared witness and a suspect who proved good will by turning himself in
even joey venza
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail
it wasnt a bad bust he gave himself up because he knew i was gonna nab him
you apprehended him after he gave himself up
but i got him hes in jail wasnt that the point
discourage it but stay with her if you cant call it in first so we can have a car on tail shes agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine okay lets check it out

major bell here sir we have to tell these people that were friendly that this whole thing was a mistake is anyone trying to contact the ship
were going damn well tell the press that there was an accident chemical warfare spill that cover cannot be violated in any way understand me shermin
shermin shermin
i just retired
what
george do you hear me george
im afraid we cant let you go
no deal
youre talking about taking a life the most unique life form on this planet i think were better than that
youre a career intelligence officer shermin youll be in the air with us
then youre going to have to do it without me
no we dont
thats the chance we have to take
well do that but how are we going to hold him he can change himself into a man he can disappear
you can change a directive george youve done it before listen to me hes going somewhere in death valley lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop east is the nuclear site there are no roads in there she was teaching him to hitchhike im telling you we block the four roads into death valley and we got him
youre not hearing me
ive never been taken off an assignment in my life give me twenty four hours and ill have him for you
washington thinks its too late for that
we dont have to do it that way we can catch him this time
we have a new directive im taking over
whats all this for
shermin
hello george
you just do your job shermin well make the policy
im not being unpatriotic and im doing my damndest to catch them bells up on and im down here on past grand junction theyre heading west if theyre not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them all im asking is that you people think about it
is that whats affecting your performance
maybe look this is just something to think about from what i got at the shopping center it was more scared than anything else i dont feel its as big a threat as you think it is
so far youve let it cross the heart of america for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security i dont see the humor in that
george listen to what youre saying this things changed itself into a man disappearing may not be that big a deal
i dont care where youre from you just cant disappear into thin air
ill make this as simple as i can george they disappeared
were growing very concerned back here theres no use pretending otherwise were rapidly approaching a condition red people are beginning to ask difficult questions
im gonna be here if you need anything
youll get results one way or the other thats for sure okay
we dont know what else to do we need results
its messy the things got a gun were just asking for somebody to get killed
dammit shermin earlier you were asking for help whats changed
i dont like it george
im afraid the situation demands that kind of risk
you sure you want this because thats putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over
oh shit
the extraterrestrial now looks like this
its made itself look like the womans dead husband
clarify that
its taken on a disguise
why did you let it get into a populated area
yes its kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere
its in a green mustang
well were in pursuit of a green mustang
when can we expect containment
george weve just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial
you have to were trying to contact the ship if we do ill let you know immediately good luck
dont let them do it this way george its too important we cant find this thing alone
weve been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public its been decided not to expand the search at this time
thats not going to happen george unless you get us the help you promised us
well get those answers when you find the one youre looking for
not necessarily bad if they knew we were here why didnt they let us know they were coming
we dont think thats necessarily bad at least its a point of contact
then its not an accident that they found us
what do you mean by contain
contain it and get back to me
wait wait what are my orders if we find this thing
im going to the white house right now ill try and get you everything you need
well need a lot of help george you could hide an army up here
neither did i
get the body out of there load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson theyll take it from there we didnt expect this shermin
none and theres another one in the area thats alive i dont know if its the only one i dont know if it was left here by accident or its part of an inva
is there any possibility that its a hoax could you be mistaken
i saw it with my own eyes weve killed an extraterrestrial and
theres no mistake youre absolutely sure
its real george
watch it theyre coming out
i wont let anyone hurt you
okay
if i dont speak to mr shermin im hanging up
you can speak to me mrs haydn im in charge of this operation now
i want to speak to marc shermin
this is george fox
mrs haydn
is he on his way to lathrop wells
he doesnt want to hurt anybody please leave him alone
mrs haydn
do you know what you were kidnapped by
mr shermin im hanging up now if you want to ask me any questions call me at home in a couple of days im in the book
marc shermin
mr im sorry what was your name again
get a highway patrol unit over there
i told you he let me go im on my way home
is the man who kidnapped you there now
no youll want to ask a lot of questions i dont want to answer right now i already have a ride
youve been through quite an ordeal mrs haydn why dont you stay where you are and let us pick you up well fly you home
i dont know someplace called elmos look i just wanted to tell you that im all right and im on my way home
this is marc shermin where are you mrs haydn
were ready
you get that lyman
i did
tell him im not here
maybe hes turned her into one of them they enter the crowd around the helicopter
doesnt make sense
i know she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus he didnt stay on though and they drove off together
did your people have any contingencies rehearsed
bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow
good it looks like we might be the welcoming committee so i think we should try and figure out what were gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature
any reports about monsters people in halloween masks anything like that
thats because the ones that were hurt died they couldnt talk to you
give it a rest lyman
this is crazy what were we going to do if that had been the ship we have two thirty calibre machine guns three ms and some handguns
i wouldnt worry about it there might not be any little league tomorrow
aghh im supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow
get fox
is it for real
you jerk you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you thinkll come out of this you know whats gonna come out of this the end of religion the end of civilization the end of the earth we could become slaves we could become a colony of these things dont you see that are you too stupid to see that
you have no conception of this do you
bullshit
jesus lyman youre an ignorant fool
save us all a lot of trouble
theyre gonna let some local cop blow him away
then why did they try and sneak in the back door tell me that why didnt they contact us first and say
im telling you theyre probably friendly
it was the husband the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman
nothing up there the grass is matted down in a few places but that could have been anything
the police think he was high on drugs
it was a man though right
listen to this a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange clicking gibberish
it was kind of like clicking maybe a language wasnt it
how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that things helmet
i tried it once fourteen years ago i was a lousy husband and a worse father the only thing im good at is this at least until yesterday
yes
to the same woman
twentyeight years
you married major
i know but
it was only an accident that we discovered them
theres nothing no reports of sightings or landings or anything in the other parts of the country or overseas seems like a totally isolated incident
we better get it into the box come on
oh jesus
ive been investigating sightings for seventeen years mr shermin this ones real we have a dead extra terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive weve been visited its finally happened and the sooner washington accepts that and starts figuring out how were going to deal with these beings the better off were going to be
people have made mistakes in these situations before
after i called in i had a chance to sit down with the three locals they swear theres another one that didnt make the ship it might be alive
it could have been anything
no sir radar
was there visual contact
we had a flight of fs play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour then it shot straight up and disappeared
waitll you see it
theres a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then
no
can you see under the faceplate
not on the landscape were trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but its hard going
any signs of biological contamination excessive radiation anything like that
very beautiful country up here
this has always been my favorite time of day
we will somethings wrong here shes helping him now
thats what i thought so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late you know
i wouldnt think so
eh the store tells you to call when theres trouble so they wont get sued but that shouldnt matter if theres a reward right
hey he didnt look like no big time criminal to me
you saw that
hey its none of my business why youre chasing a retard you want my opinion its the girl she had to hold the guys hand all the way to the car like he was a kid
yeah thanks we appreciate that
because im the one who called the police you know
huh eh no there isnt
is there a reward in this
hold on a minute lets take the chance george
if i talk to you i will miss my ship
all the roads into death valley are blocked wed like to talk to you
i dont want to hurt anybody i just want to go home
we cant let you do that
i must get to my ship mr shermin
hello
and i love you pete
dell i cant write unless im happy and i cant be happy unless im here and with you this is me delly pete appleton and i love you
pete im so sorry about what they did to you i didnt think youd come back i thought youd want to write again
i see you got the telegram
mr chairman as i understand it the fifth amendment pertains to selfincrimination and i cant incriminate myself because ive done nothing wrong besides incrimination is why you have mr clyde working for you
tell them pete tell them
okay whats the second thing
just remember two things first the law is a living thing it made us free and it keeps us free sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes sometimes it makes mistakes sometimes big mistakes but in the end the law prevails for the just sometimes it takes a while
delly thanks thank you ill take good care of this
not exactly light reading i know believe it or not ive read this since high school and it got me all the way through law school besides theres something in there thatll help you you wont have to get very far its near the beginning
damn
did you bring along something to read
maybe we could train cat to run the projector you know a system of scratching posts and gears and levers
and whos gonna run the projector until you get back mrs terwilliger
i wish you were coming with me
youll be fine no matter what leo kubelsky says youve got a hundred and seventyfive years of american law on your side dont forget that
yeah except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact
youve got everything
whatever happens
youll stand by me
i am too
what about you delly
forget about all that you want to do the right thing then defend your name if someone says something about you thats untrue you have to stand up and say so i know the law and the laws on your side
come on delly look at the country today were fighting communists in korea were paranoid about the russians weve got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb you think they want suspected communists entertaining the american public with party propaganda like gosh i dont know sand pirates of the sahara
but if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care besides why should it even matter if you were a communist
the truth is im a lot of things but communist isnt one of them
i believe you
thanks i like it i think
you know its going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete pete pete its a nice name
well let me tell you im not luke i know who i am now and you dont and i dont like me very much
oh yes yes he was
this luke was a pretty good guy wasnt he
yeah im sure a lot more people down in la want a piece of me
im sure a lot of people down in la are worried sick about you
hi
hi
no i cant i have to i cant
delly shhhhhh
delly im im not harry wasnt my father and im not im not luke
i see
well everything it started coming back a couple of days ago i remember everything now
what do you remember
guess i mustve learned
it never used to be you were two left feet on the dance floor like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step
thanks
your dancings very good
thats pretty frightening
alex and charlie simple alex is the smarter one
how do you tell those two apart anyway
oh okay
nope just filling in the blanks
now did you remember that or
no kidding
exactly and he got good
he started practicing and he left me alone from then on
you had a hidden agenda though see when he was five or six little spence used to follow you around like a puppy bothered the hell out of you but as soon as you gave him the clarinet
huh that was nice of me
back in you heard benny goodman play for the first time so you went out and got a used clarinet you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him you tried hard but it wasnt long before it was clear that benny goodman would never be looking over his shoulder so you gave the clarinet to spencer
my what
no theyre not id say your investment was paying dividends
theyre not bad
oh
you tried to once it was pretty pitiful
i dont smoke
when did you start smoking
have you got a cigarette
well theres got to be a way
a loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who cant account for the last nineandahalf years of his life not likely
what about a loan you could go to the bank
yeah and needless to say none of us has that kind of money lying around
nine hundred
its gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place delly
you know everyones so excited about the bijou reopening
oh
weve done this before so many times the last time was so long ago but it feels like yesterday
what
this is strange do you feel it
and its just well deja vu
oh
no you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before
eventually we were going to be engaged when you came back from overseas
were we going to get married
im fine really
do you have the
nothing
what was that
yes hic
we were in love werent we
yeah
no you are i know exactly what you mean its not that youre missing something its that the other person gives something to you that you had all the time you just didnt see it until they came along
no its okay see when two people belong together the other person should be the the key that unlocks the rest of you im not making sense am i
im sorry
actually i was married for four years but well we didnt fit together im divorced now
you dont have a boyfriend or anyone you know like that
oh well i guess you in high school you were a pretty good first baseman and we were on the debate team together but i think you were gonna run the bijou you were brought up there and you loved it so much and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that
what did what did i want to be
you dont remember but yes ever since i was a little girl
have you always wanted to be a lawyer
sorry you dont know how many times ive heard that a lady lawyer are you crazy like a woman couldnt be as good a lawyer as a man or better in fact
whoa
and why not
so youre really gonna be a lawyer
after they commissioned it no one could ever agree on where to put it the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall everyone finally got tired of the fighting so they stuck it down here
it doesnt seem right this being down here it ought to be where people can see it
right here albert lucas trumbo and all the others i knew them all so did you we went to school with most of them
through the door it comes apart
howd they get it inside
of course there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here
be a gentleman you have to help me down
why me
you first
you must not remember anything come on
city hall
well where can we go
then why do i feel like were still being shadowed
go on home folks and thanks for the welcome
you can all go home now hes not going anywhere
i did huh
yeah a little i think you grew an inch or so and youve lost weight
i do
you look different
me too
no i i just wondering where youve been all this time
what
ive seen you before your picture
do you remember me
well then as what did you go
thats not a contradiction at all sir i went to the meeting but i didnt go as a member
yet youre contradicting yourself you earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist partyrun organization yet you just said under oath that you were not now nor ever a member of the communist party
im not refuting anything
are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony
no sir
are you now or have you ever been a member of the communist party
mr chairman the witness is being nonresponsive
well i know that i lost my job because of one meeting i went to when i was a kid in college i know that ive been branded a communist which im not but even if i was it shouldnt matter or what do we have a bill of rights for
all right mr appleton that was what you knew then what do you know now
well if youd seen miss angstrom
are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl
well thats what i knew then or who i knew i should say you see i was trying to court miss angstrom i went to the meeting to impress her
we see it for the record it reads lucille angstrom whats the point of this
well id direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirtysix of the document and the name printed and signed there
start with what you knew then
mr clyde do you want to know what i knew then or do you want to know what i know now theyre two different things
mr appleton please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the bread instead of bullets club
yes it does
referring to line thirtyseven of the document does your printed name and signature appear there
yes yes i do
good good now i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the bread instead of bullets club of the university of california los angeles dated october a copy of this paper is before you mr appleton do you recognize it
mr clyde i remember everything
im interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past or if theyve been conveniently blotted out as a result of your accident
sir are you referring to the fact that i was suffering from amnesia and ive since recovered my memory
and what is the state of your memory now
yes
anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your accident mr appleton an accident which conveniently came hard upon your dismissal from united pictures tell us this accident of yours are we given to understand that it affected your memory
yes sir but i didnt go to lawson to run the bijou that was that was something that just happened you see i was involved in an accident in lawson and i spent some time recovering there
now i see that youve been running a movie theater in lawson called the bijou is that also true
well im sure were all glad to see you came through it all right
yes sir
yes i see that private trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead i also see that you were posted stateside during the war fort dix
mr clyde youre twisting things around i wasnt masquerading luke trumbo luke was a good man who gave his life for his country i just happen to look a little bit like him thats all
is that because you were masquerading as luke trumbo while you were in lawson
luke trumbo we never met but id like to think i know him
mr appleton do you know an albert lucas trumbo
sir that is true
mr appleton you will
mr chairman theres another amendment that id like to invoke at this time but its not the fifth amendment i wonder if youre familiar with it
go ahead son
i i need a drink of water
mr appleton mr appleton
im sorry sir i have no intention of making light of this committee and i have no intention of incurring your wrath mr chairman i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath theyve sent me letters from jail
mr appleton you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the united states congress believe you me you do not want to incur our wrath
the witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee as long as its the truth
im a little hesitant to say
um no i dont have a statement at this time
yes a prepared statement
a statement
now were informed that you have a statement youd like to read is that correct
ill do my best mr chairman
the chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today mr appleton we certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee
peter kenneth appleton hollywood california
be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record
i do
do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the united states house of representatives will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
dont mention it welcome home luke
thanks for the lift cecil

the jimmy stewart picture i remember that one saw it over at the bijou so you remember that huh
its a wonderful life
whats that
well this place sorta reminds me of something
but what
no but
you ever been in this town before to your knowledge
yes
mr fitts with all due respect i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market and i think lawson deserves the bijou theres not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain weve all felt
so you do intend to fix the place up after all
you think it over no reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building
a super market huh
the days of the storefront grocery are numbered i plan on putting up a freestanding supermarket
thats well thats very generous but if youve already got a store
luke im hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation ill come to the point i want to buy the property and im prepared to offer sixthousand dollars for it and thats just for the property mind you if you want ill leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has and you keep those proceeds i just want the land
well he loves the place its his home
i can only imagine you know i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands i dont think he gave it very much thought
were gonna try place needs a lot of work
and i hear you and harry are planning on reopening the bijou
thanks
like ernie said were all glad to have you back

fortytwo was a lean year around here the war had just started you were gone less than a month and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket and a chickens as good as money if you ask me at that time it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures

no of course not why should you be sorry youre the new peter appleton you exercised your rights as a solid citizen first amendment freedom of speech all that very noble
im not sorry for what i said
that was quite a show you gave them today we shoulda sold tickets
peter dont let that stop you all of a sudden
its wrong leo
lest we forget peter your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than lukes
thats not the country luke fought for
next time it might be the fbi the time after that it might be the president but itll always be someone count on it
so it doesnt make any difference that im not one now and have never been one
exactly
and i wont be a communist anymore
however youre gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the unamerican activities committee when they open hearings in los angeles now if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear theyll clear you
well thats a relief i understand they usually dont let that stop them
the fbi cant arrest you because you havent done anything wrong
yes leo goddammit this isnt fair
dont say that there is no such thing as a blacklist now are you gonna play ball
so it is a blacklist
thats the one ashes to ashes i think its great but itll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head you cant work until youre cleared and believe me starting right now im gonna do everything i can to make that happen
ashes to ashes
peter i believe in you more to the point i read your new script um
yeah well thats enough
they dont want you to testify because youre not a big enough fish for them they just dont want you writing pictures for now thats all
why not
you cant testify
at least i was on our side look they want me to testify ill testify ill tell em anything they want to hear jesus leo this is my career
you broke your arm you were coming out of a bar you were drunk
exactly
i know a purple heart
i was decorated

leo youre my agent tell them to take a flyin piss i didnt do anything wrong i fought in the war for crissakes
they know you were at that meeting peter theyve been told and they know
what that im accused of being a communist when i dont happen to be one
kid that cuts no ice with them
i dont know who fingered me but im not a communist
you should watch what you say
leo i was trying to impress a skirt you know me im non political republican democrat communist theres not a dimes worth of difference between em anyway
so youre saying that its true you went to a meeting of a known communist organization
no yeah i i dont know maybe i did leo this was before pearl harbor i was in college it was a bunch of kids and i was just one of em i didnt believe in what they were saying hell i didnt even know what they were saying
congress the fbi red channels it dont matter who the hell they is they know who they are thats all that matters now did you go to any meetings

are you saying its a mistake that you didnt go to any meetings they say you did
i i dont believe this

its none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to
i know mother
perhaps im oldfashioned i know it was supposed to be very warm there mitch but well actually well the newspaper said she was naked
yes mother
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer isnt she
i know mother
youd think he could manage to keep her name out of print shes always mentioned in the columns mitch
i suppose so her father owns a big newspaper in san francisco
forgive me i suppose im just naturally curious about a girl like that shes very rich isnt she
mother where did you go to law school
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
no i only led her into believing i believed she was mother its really very complicated
she was selling birds
yes
in a bird shop
i told you we met yesterday
how long have you known her
yes
and certainly pretty
yes very
shes a charming girl isnt she mitch
never mind the law cathy you can start serving the soup
im simply quoting the law
whose side are you on
caviat emptor mother let the buyer beware
he sold the feed to me didnt he
i dont know what good thatll do chickens wont eat
theres nothing wrong with those chickens mitch im going to call fred brinkmeyer right now
ill pick you up miss daniels where are you staying

lovebirds i see
yes lovebirds we couldnt let you
you did say birds
miss daniels is staying for the weekend in fact ive already invited her to dinner tonight
across at brinkmeyers
for cathy for her birthday by the way where is she
oh i see
a delivery mother miss daniels brought some birds from san francisco
how do you do miss daniels acknowledge a what
melanie daniels melanie my mother
a what
i had to acknowledge a delivery mother id like you to meet
i thought i saw your car what are you doing in town
well use smoke pots like the army uses
theres an ordinance against burning anything in this town unless its
now hold it mitch you dont know that for a fact
he was killed last night by birds
goodnight lydia
thanks al well be all right
well if theres anything else i can do mitch
no you got quite a mess here ill admit that maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney seems a little pointless though freak accident like this wouldnt happen again in a million years you want some help cleaning up
does this room look silly
eleven in the middle of the party some gulls came down at the children and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after
oh yeah yeah how old is she now
what im trying to say mitch is these things happen sometimes you know aint much we can do about it
these birds were
didnt know how he got in there had a broken leg turned out just fluttering all around there
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once
all right ill grant you a birdll panic in an enclosed room but they didnt just get in they came in right down that chimney
whats more likely they got in the room and was just panicked thats all
well well these birds attacked us
i dont think i get you mitch do about what
what are we going to do about it al
cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know sure is a peculiar thing
yes but the curtains were drawn
no i gotta admit this is peculiar did you have a light burning or something
not by the thousands
well these birds live in chimneys you know
we know what it is al
thats a chimney swift all right
i i dont think so if we get through town i think well be all right
can we turn back
well take it slow until we get to the main road are you ready
mitch if they hear the car starting if they see movement
no wait hold me
wed better light some of those lamps
wait here dont move
mitch
the power
i dont want to be safe i want to be with you
youd have been safe in san francisco

maybe
santa rosa
inland
where are they heading
yes im tired mitch im so very very tired

i tried a little while ago the phones dead
do you want to try your father again
it may not be last week again for a long long time
even the birds sitting out there it does look very much the same mitch this could be last week
it it doesnt look very different does it a little smoke over the town but otherwise
i keep thinking of annie
the past fifteen minutes it seems to be a pattern doesnt it they strike and disappear and then they start massing again
how long have they been gathering there
the bay doesnt
the town looks clear
weve got to get cathy
dont lets take any chances
i think its safe to get out now
at annies house shes all right
i got here as fast as i could wheres cathy

im frightened and confused and i i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and and concrete and
no no
im frightened mitch
melanie melanie
no theyre having a meeting melanie your sparrow is standing on a soap box and
it makes you feel as if theyre theyre waiting or resting or
i hadnt thought of that and then the swifts came
after the gulls attacked
what do you mean
it was like that yesterday
its so damn quiet out there
with my little sparrow leading team
theyre probably hungry thats all this was a bad summer they eat berries and and nuts you know and the hills are all burned out so theyre probably searching for food wherever they can get it
mmm
what it was probably
you have nothing to lose but your feathers
take wing
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages birds of the world unite
hear hear
why should we submit ourselves to their domination
hear
sure but eventually even the more seriousminded birds began to listen why should humans rule they asked themselves
well theyll go along with anything
not at first oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
so they united
yes of course he had to have a beard birds of the world unite he kept saying over and over
growing a beard
it all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills a malcontent he went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings werent fit to rule this planet preaching wherever anyone would listen
certainly of birds
of birds
its an uprising
really tell me about it
its hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday isnt it its so beautiful and still now i think ive got it all figured out by the way
it smelled of the fire
i think i should dont you

how can you tell
some of them are

well we cant just let them fly around the shop you know
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this
doesnt what make me
those are canaries miss doesnt this make you feel awful

i got it you hire a private eye fly him out there he follows her around a couple days shell never know a thing
they told me they dont help out stalkers look maybe theyre right its been a long time
youre kidding what did they say
i also called unsolved mysteries
so that was it one bump in the road and you gave up
i did try calling her a few years ago she wasnt listed
what if youre wrong you just said shes the only girl you ever loved what have you got to lose by calling her
because i guarantee shes married and has a couple kids girls like mary dont stay single

i cant believe this is happening im supposed to be meeting him in an hour
ive got a friend in the boston police department he faxed me this this morning ill just give you the highlights after a short stint as a petty thief patrick r healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen at sixteen he committed his first murder a pretty teachers aid named molly pettygrove he was incarcerated until age twentytwo when despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him in his mid twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington unfortunately the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasnt enough evidence to hold him and on and on and so forth and so on
what
mary the mans a killer
tucker i appreciate you doing all this but im really strapped for time here and
i think youd better sit down

i appreciate you looking out for me
i mean lets face it mary youre beautiful youve got money you trust people im just saying theres a lot of psychos out there
no no no tucker thank you
i thought so anyway i hope you dont think im being meddlesome i just think you should be careful with this guy
look its just that something about him struck me as odd last night he gave me this funny vibe anyway i called some friends back east they dont know of any architect named patrick healy and hes not listed as a harvard alumnus
ive been looking for a guy not one of these south beach pussies
thats what youve been looking for a farter
not long at all but i really like him okay i know hes a little different tucker but thats what i like about him hes a guy a real guy he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isnt always politically correct and he probably farts too and thats okay with me
well thats what im trying to figure out how long have you known him
hes a nice guy isnt he
no no the bigger the better but i must say they could be a little brighter nothings sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites
you dont think theyre too big
tucker you look different some how did you do something with your hair

ive got a gift just like you do my gift is i just know what people mean even if they cant say it it helps when youre trying to communicate with fighter pilots like what you just said was im embarrassed i feel ive done something wrong that ive failed and i dont think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting intelligent woman like yourself that about it
how could you
i know exactly what you mean
i didnt want to see you i mean i didbut i didnt
long distance i wouldnt do that to you id at least talk to you
i was later
you werent gonna say goodbye
well say it together on the count of threeonetwo
whos gonna win
looks like a tie
your watch
one more
and thats one
thats three
you didnt mean it you didnt think youd do anything to take it back
that wasnt fair it was a question penalty round
what does it mean
thats up to you
off me or off you
take something off
now
true
goose is dead
the big one the one thats most on your mind
what truth
you say the truth go ahead dont be afraid you want to win the game dontcha
how does it go
want to play the game
not as silly as some you know the silliest one that we are gods that we control events on the beach that we can turn back time
youre crazy thats a pretty silly game
its like strip poker only without the bluffing one person says something and if the other one accepts that its true the one who says it gets to take one item of clothing off
strip reality how do you play that
its strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play
how do you play reality
i like to play reality
what kind of games
i sit i think i play games
what do you do when you come here
everything passes immutable law of the universe
it does
only when youre depressed then it passes
hardly ever
you dont believe that
of course the lines just imaginary you can cross it twenty timesnothing really changes
thats what i want
you look way out there out past the date line west becomes east all things change you cross the linetoday becomes yesterdayor tomorrow i forget which
yesterday
what
i want it back
what do you want
no
i dont think so but if thats what you want
im not good company i should be alone
do what show you a good time
you dont have to do this
where are we you know where we are its called the beach its where life first crawled up out of the sea i come here sometimes when i feel like crawling back in
where are we
you knew it you all do its part of it maybe the most important part
not to me
why you act like you didnt know one day this would happen
maybe i shouldnt take it
thats what you get flight pay for
i was flyingmy responsibility
thats not what i hear
he was a friend of mine a good guygreat guy it was my fault
the dark side the price you pay for all the fun youre having you knew about it of course didnt you
what
this is it then
im fine
they say youre alright
pawn shop whats to eat
whered you get it
just good luck
what do you take me for its a navy cross
lucky charm
why whats gonna happen
doesnt it ever bother you
yeah
danger
i dont fly in anything that doesnt show movies
you ever fly an f
im still second best
well noinverse order
in that order
foodand youmy f
im a professional you guys are in my line of work
why
no fooling on base no signs no comments no talk by anyone
anything
i want it understood
i dont know yet
you always get what you want
and now i want you
and now
i always wanted to fly ever since i first saw a jet i wanted to fly jets then i wanted fs then i wanted to fly off carriers then i wanted top gun
i dont know i dont like being out of control
you want to go ballistic
where
come on
thanks very much care for some suchi
youre totally insane
what
its just as i thought
i watched my mother die cancer she had a long time to think about it they say you reach an agreement with death come to accept the fact that pretty soon you wont be here i didnt see that she was very bravebraver than i am you go up there there isnt time to think if you make a mistake youre just a smudge on the ground simplifies funeral arrangements
are you really that brave
what if you kill yourself think of everything youll miss maverick there is lots of stuff i dont know about fine wine great art the opera i guess if i live long enough ill get to it if i dont ill never miss it
all youve got is one life i guess its worth about the same to every body you ever see an old woman after her husband has died and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead when youre in the air and doing something really dangerous you can look ahead maybe ten seconds thats your whole future thats as far as it goes but imagine what those seconds are worth
what he saidtheres nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result
winston churchill
thats it of course when im up there and doing it im cheating it every second im subverting all lawsgravitywhatever im skating the edge of it
you dont believe any of this you dont think youll ever die
you know what really scares me living too long losing my hair and my teethand my guts and my wind and my brainssitting in a room with my hands in my lap watching daytime tv
they know the rules thats the deal thats why youre up there its him or me thats the price of admission it bothers you why youre part of it everybody dies most people dont get to die for something
does it bother you
about as much as they think about killing me
you ever think about killing another human being
somebody does its more honest this way you do your own dirty work
you dont have to kill it
youre not cause you eat frozen meatballs things die every time you breathe you kill millions of tiny organisms every time you eat something had to die
youre horrible
its not suffering anymore
no
i dont enjoy watching things suffer
thats true what are you
youre an animal
it dies we live
whyd you do that
okay anything justgo ive gotta work
anything
make what
lets make it at eight
im starting to sense that now
im different
used to what
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpitplay with the levers and things maverick well get used to it
what plane
what about the plane
a date coffee a drinka walk in the park
hard to argue with that isnt it
how about anything anything you want to do
how about what
dont worry im a new strain and i dont give up everything ive ever wanted ive had to work like hell for well how about it
and probably never again its nothing personal its justi know a lot of pilots maybe im immune
you have to shoot him downif hes smart hell turn away before that happens

you like to work alone ive heard that about you
i think i can work it out on my own
need a hint
nope
who is the best
figured out what
figured it out yet
well hes in trouble and he didnt even get here yet
three guesses
whos the hell is that
some guys never get it back
so have i
ive seen this before
its only been a week keep sending him up
he just wont engage he cant do it skipper he cant get back on the horse
not only that but zorro got your wingman nice going
walked right into it
yeah we get one of these guys every damn class maverick
hes seat of the pants completely unpredictable nothing by the book all over the sky but i dont know skip hes really got something
tell me one thing
i dont know what to tell you skip
but you continued to fight
just below ten thousand
the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet jester at what point did you call off the fight
what makes you think we can get back in we dont have the fuel for this maverick just get me to him
helping him in
what the hell you doing
iforgot something
cougar this is maverick im getting hungry lets head for the barn cougar where are you
speaking of feet fuels down to were gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station
ah the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat
hows it goin coog
morning coogan
no really she came ruined ya think he knows it was me
you didnt help
the girl with the purple fingernails was coogans sister
bad
it was bad
didnt everybody
you won
the wings
yes sir
yes sir
that is all tell me about the mig some other time
sir
you just did an incredibly brave thing what you should have done was land your plane you dont own that plane the taxpayers do i should ream you out for it but it just doesnt work with you youre a hell of a flyer you are maybe too good you never really stepped in it yet so this is your chance im gonna send you up against the best they are better than you maybe theyll knock that shine off your eagle and youll see finally where discipline and teamwork fit it maverick hasnt really heard anything but topgun he snaps out of it
me
was going now you are
i talked a man back once three months later we lost him its his decision only he knows
hes a good pilot
ill have to think about it i dont know about them i do know one thing weve got a lot invested in you wed hate to lose it even more than those other guys naval aviation needs a very few very good men
would you take me back would they
i didnt say that thats up to you i think that if you do if you choose to come back youll be a better pilot a better man
you think i shouldnt fly
kid the plain fact isyou are im not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass technically they absolved you you and i know what really happened you pushed it you are responsible and youll always carry that you know what ill carry it too i should have taken you out of that cockpit i guess im a hopeless romantic i always try to find something worthwhile in someones death its no tradeoff its not one for one what you learned isnt worth his death it couldnt be but maybe there is some value in it i know its the first thing ive ever seen thats really gotten to you now the question is what will you do with it if it gets you out of flight statusso you dont kill yourself or anybody elsethats good thats one good thing you were an accident waiting to happen
how can i go on i feel so responsible
its not true
not something they tell dependents
i never heard that
they waved him off he thought he knew better he hit the ramp
he was by the book all the way
you may not think so but you are
im nothing like him
vf the oriskany you remind me of him youre just like he was only betterand worse
i know
sometimes its luck but in this case he earned it i served with your old man
i didnt say that thats up to you but i have responsibility for the other guys up there not just you they need to know youre all rightthat they can depend on you
you think i should quit
its no disgrace kid that spin was hell it would wreck anyones confidence you could be a good pilot again someday
i didnt know either thats why i told jester to prepare your papers
i dont know
or you can quit
or
we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except cnc course not completed no explanation required theoretically it doesnt hurt your career but people always wonder about things like that
she said you took your kid to the each every second sunday zoo or beach or the ballgame yhave the option what about me
my wifes house
i called your house
no bother
skipper sorry to bother you
my first squadron in vietnam we lost eight out of eighteen planes ten guys the first one kills you but therell be othersyou can count on it
he wasmy responsibilitymy rio
i know i was there
goose is dead
all right
how do you feel
the flying the fighting id go up there ten times a day to fight id win at least nine of them thats all i want to do its what i do best i am real good just give me the jet
oh you mean the thrill
for the same reason you are
then why are you here
its my own way it works for me i dont care about the rest of that stuff
talent is no holy shield von richtofen was killed by a farm boy instincts are not enough do it our way weve worked these things out the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive why do you have to do everything the hard way
i can take care of myself
of course you did i said a great flyer not a smart one you fly reckless great instincts no discipline that ambush today you followed your emotions instead of your wingman of course you got killedand well deserved to it was a really stupid mistake in battle it gets people killed
i lost
twenty years experience i couldnt shake you you may be a great flyer i mean that
engaging the other guy wood youre on your own
snapshotmissed him
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane
i wasnt thinking i just did it
the rules of engagement are not flexible they exist for your safety you will obey them is that clear
we werent below for more than ten seconds there was no danger i had the shot i took it
why
is that how you remember it
i had him in view i was peeling over the egg into a dive he saw me when i moved in for the kill there wasnt any danger
a good man good flyer
yes sir
youre father was marvin mitchell
ahhh runs in the family sir
maverick whered you get that call sign
i like that in a fighter pilot its okay to be confident you have to think youre king kong to want to try to land on carriers just keep in mind the other component of successteamwork

you really are dangerously cute honey i gotta admit it
i love it when your eyes get wild honey they light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of em oh sailor youre so aware of what goes on with me i mean you pay attention and i swear you got the sweetest cock sometimes its like its talkin to me when youre inside like its got a voice all its own you get right on me

honey were goin to bed now and its time to change the subject
honest lula i probly aint precisely got all the facts straight but its about what they said
sailor ripley you stop youre makin this shit up and i aint gonna sit for it
how they used to do it course they got more sophisticated ways now radio said the chinese i think it is figured a better idea is by insertin a balloon in the forehead and lettin it hang down on the nose
sailor you expect me to believe a mand be goin around with a arm sewed to his nose
yeah well listen to this radio said back in the s a italian doctor figured out that if say a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in say a barfight or somethin theyd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks then put leeches on it
i got one on me at lake lanier lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off felt awful he was a cute boy though so it was almost worth it
heard on the radio how doctors is usin leeches again just in old times you know when even barbers used em
yeah its a real problem for me sailor you know when i went in that drugstore by the restaurant in biloxi i saw em by the register and the girl throw em in im not big on resistin so what about a leech
got you a pack of mores again huh
say what honestly sugar you can talk more shit sometimes
lula i learned somethin interestin today on a science show i heard on the radio how leeches is comin back into style
mississippi you can almost hear that jazz blowin up from the big no
lets get fed sweetheart the lights fadin fast
its huge this musta been a grand old place at one time
there aint no water in the swimmin pool just a dead tree fell in probly from bein struck by lightnin
whats that honey
come look at this
i hate hotel bedspreads they dont hardly never get washed and i dont like the idea of lyin on other peoples dirt
looks more like the ghost of the old south but well try her
how about that one the host of the old south hotel
we oughta stay somewhere outta the way not in no holidays or ramadas or motel six if johnnie farraguts on our trail hell check those first
got anyplace special in mind
almost i figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat
thats disgustin those kinda sentiments shouldnt be allowed out in public is this biloxi yet
what it says on the bumper sticker up front on that pickup
what kinda trash talk is that
life is a bitch and then you marry one
thank the lord well you aint let me down yet sailor thats moren i can say for the rest of the world
okay manslaughterer whos broke his parole and got in mind nothin but immoral purposes fars youre concerned
manslaughterer honey not murderer dont exaggerate
you aint gonna begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour are you sugar i mean here you are crossin state lines with a anumber one certified murderer
yeah i guess but and heres the lesson part they aint supposed to be so bad for you
they sure do stink
it aint its part of the lessons of life i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape
that dont smell like a more
we got through two states already
you got about six more big states to go before we find out
whatll it be like in california sailor do you think i hear it dont rain much there
you guess my parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt portagee county
i suppose so she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung but i dont figure she counted on us takin off together like this i guess this means youre breakin parole then
what do you mean by necessary shes probly already called the cops my parole officer her pi boyfriend johnnie farragut
ill drop mama a postcard from somewhere i mean i dont want her to worry no moren necessary
sorta brown blonde i guess but dig this sweetie then she turns over peels off them orange pants and spreads her legs real wide and says to me
poor baby she dont know what she missed what color hair she have
her face was halfpushed into the pillow and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said i wont suck you dont ask me to suck you
youre excitin me honey whatd she do
she just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air i slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it
i guess
you mean like pedal pushers
thats just what she said i had a boner with a capital o i went to kiss her but she broke off laughin and ran down the hallway i found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and penthouse magazines she was a wild chick she was wearin bright orange pants with kind of spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides you know them kind that doesnt go all the way down your leg
oh baby what a bad boy you are
when she got almost to the top step i stuck my hand between her legs from behind
told her my name then she said somethin like its so noisy down here why dont we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves she turned around and led the way i knew i had an important lesson to learn that day
whatd you say to her
she looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm told me her name was irma
maybe two three months after juarez i was visitin my cousin junior train in savannah and we were at some kids house whose parents were out of town a girl comes up to me that was real tall taller than me
sorry baby whens the first time you done it with a girl who wasnt hookin
you still got plenty energy for me baby

thats an awful long way to go just to get some pussy
those toenails dry yet we got some dancin to do
id got to the far end of the world for you baby you know i would
you up for that
sailor

maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much
one thing puzzles my mind sugar youre twenty years old arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart puttin a detective on us ill tell ya lula well its moren me killin bob ray lemon
we gotta be careful honey my mamas gonna have johnnie farragut on us like a duck on a june bug and hes one clever detective you know how clever he once told me that he could find an honest man in washington my toenails gotta dry first anyways sailor
lets go dancin peanut im ready
yeah i suppose but you know somethin baby hair does make a difference
theres worse things that can happen to a man honey
hes twentyfour now a year older than you and must be bout bald
so
when he was about seventeen he startin losin his hair
whats that
too bad we all cant baby one thing about dell
sound like ol dells moren just a little confused peanut too bad he couldnt visit that ol wizard of oz and get some good advice
the private eye cost aunt rootie over a thousand dollars then a little while later dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind nobodys seen him since
it aint so funny now though december before christmas dell disappeared again and aunt rootie hired a private eye to find him he was missin for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin dressed in some filthy santa claus suit
probly the rain boys from outer space
are followin him around
one time real late like about two thirty am she found dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin sandwiches in the kitchen
hell peanut
one time aunt rootie caught dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus
well like mama told me aunt rootie dells mama she found cockroaches in dells underwear
actin funny how
dell disappeared dell was learnin a hard lesson what i learned from observin dell is i think people who are frightened want to disappear hed startin behavin weird like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin
whats that peanut
oh nothin i never let on to mama about dell bein the one i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was i didnt tell dell neither he was back home in chattanooga by then anyhow and i didnt see the point somethin terrible happened to him though six months ago
what happened to him
it was my cousin dell done it his folks used to visit with us summers
you tell the boy who knocked you up
i hope you appreciate my spendin six hundred dollars not countin what it cost us to get here and back this mans the best damn abortionist in the south
she got me an abortion
musta been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time what did you do your mama find out
it aint altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes lula i done a few things in my life i aint too proud of but ill tell ya from now on i aint gonna do nothin for no good reason all i know for sure is theres moren a few bad ideas runnin around loose out there
i just think about things as they come up i never been much of a planner

sailor that ozone layer is disappearin seems to me the government could do somethin about it one of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an xray
here she goes again
uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in myrtle beach they still got way too much traffic there for my taste and another thing baby that government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space
one hundred twenty decibels head on collision of a ford pickup and a chevy station wagon no survivors balls of flame and grinding metal
just you uncle pooch never acted strange or different after and he never did anything else to me i always got a nice present from him at christmas like a coat or jewelry
and you never told nobody about it
well sure but he was supergentle you know i mean he raped me and all but i guess theres all different kinds of rapes i didnt exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it didnt seem all that terrible it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich
we did it whattaya mean didnt he force you
he was short but powerful with hairy arms anyway he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used we did it there on an old bed
no he picked me up
so howd he finally nail you right there in the kitchen
didnt he say somethin
uncle pooch came in the side door through the porch you know where i was makin a jelly and banana sandwich i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin that night with vicki and cherry ann the desoto sisters uncle pooch must have known nobody but me was home cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter
well mama was at the busy bee havin her hair dyed and i was alone in the house
sorry sugar go on and tell me how old pooch done the deed
i said you can be too crude sometimes i dont think i care for it
i cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them mores in your mouth
youre terrible crude sometimes sailor you know
howd it happen peanut he just pull out the old toad and let it croak
thats true uncle pooch wasnt really an uncle he was a business partner of my daddys and my mama never knew nothin about me and him thats for damn sure his real name was somethin kind of european like pucinski but everyone just called him pooch he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away i always figured he was sweet on mama so when he cornered me one afternoon i was surprised moren a little
but honey i thought you told me your uncle pooch raped you when you was thirteen
sailor you are somethin else honey when i was fifteen mama told me that pretty soon id be startin to think about sex and i should talk to her before i did anything about it
grandmama pace had a long smooth white neck it was like on a statue it was so white
you have such a pretty long neck like a swan
started he couldnt remember things got real violent mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask but i dont know seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces
in a fire as i recall
you remind me of my daddy you know mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies he had a long nose too like theirs did i ever tell you how he died
youre perfect for me too
hell peanut you stuck with me after i planted bob ray lemon a man cant ask for more than that
id stand by you sailor through anything
its okay i hardly used to see them anyway i didnt have much parental guiding the public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin he was a good ol boy stood by me even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time
gee sailor im sorry honey i never would have guessed it
camels same as me guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness
what brandd she smoke
i guess i started smokin when i was about six my mama was already dead from lung cancer
well i was thinkin about smokin actually my mama smokes marlboros now used to be she smoked kools i stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade when i got old enough to buy my own i bought those now ive just about settled on mores as you probably noticed theyre longer
i really did miss your mind while i was out at pee dee honey the rest of you too of course but the way your head works is gods own private mystery what was it you was thinkin
did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone
stab it and steer
bout fifty thousand times i got us a room at the cape fear and guess what i hear powermads at the hurricane

do you think im an idiot
hey im new here what do you want
whats the problem
if you know about the church why ask such stupid questions
so if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves what do you want with drugs you like seeing lots of pretty colors when youre tearing peoples throats out
yeah okay just gimme a minute to freshen up
the adm lets go
and you call me a moron
claude
what you think claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance
bullshit youre bluffing
dont be an idiot im not the only one if i die serafine dies
youll never get the chance
no but ill kill your fucking girlfriend
or else what youll kill me
saint severin the church so you know all about the adm where is it tell me tell me or else
he didnt tell me anything all he said was saint severin
before the coma
my uncles in a coma you moron
bullshit your uncle told you
man i dont know what the fuck youre talking about
wheres the adm where did your uncle put it
yeah in new york we got an expression too goes like this
in paris we have an expression for people like you encul damericain
my men think you died and floated away in the seine if i wanted to i could let them believe that but that would be illegal
what about me
i always wanted to do that i saw it in a movie
i leave these open maybe something comes back to you
but i dont remember anything i swear
merde wait here when i return you tell me about last night huh
this is its like a sick joke i
he was a good man now his wife is a widow
oh no no
thats not all marcel officer boulard was following you
oh shit no
we know you were with her
what
you recognize her
you sure its not just coz you jerk off too much
all my life ive worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind well this is it this is power
i told him it wasnt ready
it killed him you coulda just used draino its cheaper
thats what serafine is searching for without much luck im afraid if only we could speak with him but alas hes off in another realm close to death
eight oclock shit youd think my uncle would have left a clue a note something
yes that sociopath hes given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy to him adam is just a threat to the terror he holds over others to us its salvation
because gaston was after it
yes i was able to decode the old texts and give terrence the specifications it took a lot of trial and error but finally he got it adenine dimethyloxide adm i call it adam but just before he was attacked he hid it
uncle terrence
its chemistry andy nothing more mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine like chain reaction in the infectee there were not many biochemists working in the twelfth century but with todays technology its possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to
great later on well have to get together for cocktails right now i kinda have to hurry before i grow a lot of hair and eat people say this heart thing works whats it got to do with adm
what oh right you can see these guys too jesus
i dont believe weve been introduced
yeah well what if its the weekly world news
simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed these pictures are not just myth andy the scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public this is the medieval version of a newspaper
why the fuck would i do that
youre exactly right andy i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm and now im counting on your assistance too
my god serafines right its time to go well talk soon
not you too
yeah well if i claw my face off just pack it in ice okay jesus the cops were probably right my uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him
you didnt know but then why did you well dont worry its relatively mild
terrence and i came down here to do serious work for centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate
yeah
andy
yeah well thats like really groovy and everything but who hacked my uncles legs off
hes on a new drug called zbh or daydream it allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while hes dreaming he is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time
what
you think its silly but do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep
psychic awareness right
the cops its their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception exploring new states of psychic awareness
yeah well why did he hang out here the cops said its dangerous
its horrible terrence was one of the most brilliant men ive known
i know im andy mcdermott terrences nephew
im sorry my friend im not signing books right now theres been a tragedy
i never thought id ask this of anyone andy but do me a favor and kill the evil sonofabitch will you
claude
yeah i finally checked out thank god but theres a bit of unfinished business
uncle terrence youre
ahhh the wine cellar in a bottle of chateau margaux a metal cylinder dont dont aaaah
where is it please
the adm quickly where is it
oh shit no andy dont let them take me back there
i went to st severin church now look
the adm be careful andy its very powerful how do you know about it
great but listen i need to know where you hid the adm
undead right sort of an ectocosmic manifestation what a pisser tell you one thing though timothy leary will be jealous as hell
sort of
andy i have to tell you about the dream i had or that im still having it feels like a systemic physio tropic reaction to some drug maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative but it is hyperreal id swear my legs had been cut off or wait a second im getting a strange metaphysical buzz shit im uh dead arent i
yeah look uncle terrence
andy andy is that you
uncle terrence
yeah i know back to the eiffel tower and what about you
yeah well i dont know much about chemistry but even if this stuff works you better find it by midnight otherwise its
puking on yourself in midair is not a good death
dont worry in a few seconds you wont feel a thing
shit i feel sick
but this is class kid all the way what a way to go
what the hell lots of my heroes killed themselves hemingway van gogh um herve villachaise
good man now can i have my arms back
alright let me write a letter
no we cant thats the problem god knows it would beat hanging around with you
fuck you if im gonna kill myself ill do it when im good and ready you can go to hell
what are you so damn angry about did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out huh
aaaaa get the fuck away from me
im afraid shes not so lucky shes undead and so am i
well when youre about to pop off what have you got to lose thanks for your help
not that i know
i dont know there were others much closer he was religious
why would he pick this one
just the name of this hospital st severin he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness
yeah i guess so did he say anything before the coma
andy its not so easy there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under paris its a whole other city crawling with drug addicts lunatics skinheads its no mans land
i cant believe this why dont you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn animals that attacked my uncle
maybe we should go now you must be very tired well call if any new
yeah well these fleas must have teeth like fuckin chain saws
well heres what i think happened a chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night why perhaps hes making a few francs on the side the psychedelic drug market is big these days he gets mixed up with a bad crowd and like they say if you lie with dogs you get fleas
what do you mean maniacs
vegetable right my mistake it seems he was attacked by a maniac maybe two or three maniacs just after midnight yesterday they fled into the tunnels beneath paris thats all we know
legume you mean a vegetable
no the doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time but basically he is how you say a legume
not too well he taught at the sorbonne right dad always calls him his hippie brother did some work with timothy leary i think and is he is he going to die
how well did er do you know him
jesus
right listen my uncle its not serious is it did he eat some bad snails slip on the bidet what
hes in charge but uh between you and me my english is better this way so youre from new york eh i love those hill street blues
thats mcdermott but yeah
andrew mcdairmo
oh did i hurt the little girls feelings well excusez moi i confess my desire for adm is quite intense so i deceived you and our poor friend terry a competent technician but lets face it a bit naive the great cure for lycanthropy hmph he didnt have the vision to grasp the potential of adam until it was too late and even then he came rushing down to tell me as if i would be just as shocked ha
you fucking liar
no its no cure its something much more interesting
god well dont let him go catch him
claude its andy hes acting really weird i think something happened last night
serafine is that you whats going on
andy
allo
andy stop i think he can help you
what you think everyones as ignorant as you
you think thats what mcdermott was raving about in the ambulance
you never heard the story of saint severin driving the werewolves from paris
saint severin
right little twerp thinks hes colombo
you better follow that mcdermott kid hes going to wind up like his uncle if hes not careful

but this is the key to the executive washroom
no i didnt
say baxter you gave me the wrong key
thank you sir
now youre being bright
so whats it going to be
i dig
baxter i picked you for my team because i thought you were a bright young man you realize what youre doing not to me but to yourself normally it takes years to work your way up to the twentyseventh floor but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again you dig
no key
hows that again
especially not miss kubelik
im not just bringing anybody im bringing miss kubelik
youre not going to bring anybody up to my apartment
what do you mean sorry
sorry mr sheldrake
now ill have to borrow your key
very clever
you know that other key to your apartment well when we had that little scare about miss kubelik i thought id better get rid of it quick so i threw it out the window of the commuter train
dont mind what
the only thing is im staying at the athletic club and its strictly stag so if you dont mind
i see
me too im taking miss kubelik out i finally talked her into it
naturally
i suppose youll be on the town tonight celebrating
yes sir
youre working too hard baxter its new years eve relax
heres the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover thirtyseven percent of our female employees leave to get married twentytwo percent quit because
oh
i got kicked in the head too
thats just one of the privileges that goes with this job you also get a nice little expense account the use of the executive washroom say what happened to you baxter
yes sir
oh sure sure but first the property settlement has to be worked out then it takes six weeks in reno meanwhile im going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while oh by the way you can now have lunch in the executive dining room
well its just that so many things have been happening so fast im very pleased especially for miss kubelik now that ive gotten to know her better i think shes the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody
my assistant roy thompson has been shifted to the denver office and youre taking his place whats the matter baxter you dont seem very excited
mine
you like its all yours
swell and dont think ive forgotten what you did for me this way baxter
its about miss kubelik shes all right again so she went back home
now what was your news baxter
yeah
well if you must know i fired my secretary my secretary got to my wife and my wife fired me aint that a kick in the head
you left your wife
thats right ive moved out of my house im going to be staying in town at the athletic club
youre going to take her off my hands
i know how worried you were about miss kubelik well stop worrying im going to take her off your hands
sir
and ive got good news for you baxter all your troubles are over
mr sheldrake ive got good news for you

for me i dont think so but i was hoping maybe you could do something for her
oh well if theres anything i can do for you
no thank you mr sheldrake as a matter of fact ive got some money for you a hundred dollars
good is there anything you need money
yes shes in the shower shes coming along fine considering
yes sir i understand she left a note you want me to open it and read it to you well it was just a suggestion no you dont have to worry about that mr sheldrake i kept your name out of it so therell be no trouble policewise or newspaper wise
thats impossible youll have to handle this situation yourself as a matter of fact im counting on you
i thought maybe youd like to be here when she wakes up
what
i didnt want to tell you over the phone but that certain party you know who i mean i found her here last night she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills
youre not making sense baxter whats this all about
i hate to disturb you but something came up its rather important and i think it would be a good idea if you could see me at the apartment as soon as possible
hello yes whats on your mind baxter
roger and ill get that other key
put me down for thursday again
yes sir thats the life all right
yeah you know baxter i envy you bachelor all the dames you want no headaches no complications
no sir thats very unfair especially to your wife
you see a girl a couple of times a week just for laughs and right away she thinks youre going to divorce your wife i ask you is that fair
i know how it is
you know how it is sooner or later they all give you a bad time
sir
so it was she threw it at me
the mirror is broken it was broken when i found it
oh yes thanks
i mean the young lady whoever she may be it was on the couch when i got home last night
to me
yes sir you cant be too careful
no you dont understand shes a busybody always poking her nose into things and with that key passing back and forth why take chances
oh yes very attractive is she the lucky one
you know my secretary miss olsen
well i guess so
fine and i want you to know ill work very hard to justify your confidence in me sheldrake sure you will say baxter about the apartment now that you got a raise dont you think we can afford a second key
i like the way you handled that well how does it feel to be an executive

yes of course
now remember baxter this is going to be our little secret
thank you sir

oh terribly sorry its that cold
now put down the key and put down the address

where are you going baxter
well usually i slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat but never again i can promise you that
how do you work it with the key
west th street you have no idea what ive been going through with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key
where is your apartment
oh it wont believe me and its not going to happen again from now on nobody is going to use my apartment
thats not the point four rotten apples in a barrel no matter how large the barrel you realize that if this ever leaked out
just those four out of a total of so actually we can be very proud of our personnel percentagewise
baxter an insurance company is founded on public trust any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming how many charter members are there in this little club of yours
well about six months ago i was going to night school taking this course in advanced accounting and one of the guys in our department he lives in jersey he was going to a banquet at the biltmore his wife was meeting him in town and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo so i gave him the key and word must have gotten around because the next thing i knew all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets and when you give the key to one guy you cant say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand pardon me
you better
no sir im not going to deny it but if youd just let me explain
are you going to deny it
oh
loyal cooperative resourceful c c baxter

theres a certain key floating around the office from kirkeby to vanderhof to eichelberger to dobisch its the key to a certain apartment and you know who that apartment belongs to
sir
what kind of joint are you running
what whats that got to do with me im not running any bookie joint
thats right baxter
the vice squad
in we had an employee here name of fowler he was very popular too turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the actuarial department tying up the switchboard figuring the odds on our ibm machines so the day before the kentucky derby i called in the vice squad and we raided the thirteenth floor
you do
look baxter im not stupid i know everything that goes on in this building in every department on every floor every day of the year
would you mind repeating the question
think
i dont know
tell me baxter just what is it that makes you so popular
thats very flattering
mr vanderhof in public relations and mr eichelberger in mortgage and loan theyd both like to have you transferred to their departments
well you know how it is things pile up
and mr kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office without overtime
mr dobisch said that
been hearing some very nice things about you heres a report from mr dobisch loyal cooperative resourceful
yes mr sheldrake
i was sort of wondering what you looked like sit down
yes sir
baxter
no

now will you get out
buddyboy why didnt you say so you got yourself a little playmate huh
are you going to leave mr kirkeby or do i have to throw you out
baxter i dont want to pull rank on you but i told the lady it was all set you want to make a liar out of me
look you cant stay here just take your champagne and go
whats the matter with you buddy boy i made a reservation for four oclock remember

well its all right with me bud let me check ill get back to you
instead of friday could you possibly switch to thursday youd be doing me a great favor
hello yeah baxter whats up
listen to him little lord fauntleroy
could be shes just a nice respectable girl there are millions of them
a lot of guys around here have tried it all kinds of approaches no dice what is she trying to prove
maybe youre using the wrong approach
im a pretty good operator myself but she just wont give me a tumble datewise
oh yes shes the best operator in the building
that kubelik boy would i like to get her on a slow elevator to china
yes sir they are indeed
oh how are you baxter they keeping you busy these days
good morning mr kirkeby
ill pay you on friday and whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around
yes mr kirkeby you still owe me for the last two bottles
well lay in some vodka and some vermouth and put my name on it
i know mr eichelberger in the mortgage loan department last night he had a little halloween party here
youre on your way up buddyboy and youre practically out of liquor
thats right we were discussing our department manpowerwise and promotionwise and i told him what a bright boy you were theyre always on the lookout for young executives bud thank you mr kirkeby
mr sheldrake
sure sure look kid i put in a good word for you with sheldrake in personnel
i dont mind in the summer but on a rainy night and i havent had any dinner yet
i know buddyboy i know but those things dont always run on schedule like a greyhound bus
mr kirkeby i dont like to complain but you were supposed to be out of here by eight
listen baxter we made you and we can break you
you threatening me
youll be a lot sorrier before were through with you
i sympathize with your problem and believe me im very sorry
well after all its my apartment its private property its not a public playground
we went to bat for you and now you wont play ball with us
i have a vague idea
teamwork thats what counts in an organization like this all for one and one for all know what i mean
thank you mr dobisch
thats a shame ill send the key right down and about your promotion im sending that efficiency report right up to mr sheldrake in personnel i wouldnt be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over
and i couldnt get into my apartment so at four a m i had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut
it is well how about that no wonder i couldnt get into the executive washroom this morning
oh i found a key there all right only its the wrong key
i did didnt i i distinctly remember bending over and putting it there
its not picasso im calling about its the key to my apartment you were supposed to leave it under the mat
oh buddyboy i was just about to call you im sorry about that mess on the living room wall you see my little friend she kept insisting picasso was a bum so she started to do that mural but im sure it will wash off just eyebrow pencil
yes mr dobisch
let me worry about that just leave the key under the mat and clear out
im all out of liquor and theres no clean glasses no cheese crackers no nothing
make it thirty minutes what do you say bud
its only eleven and i just want the place for fortyfive minutes
of course not but how can i be efficient in the office if i dont get enough sleep at night
look baxter were making out the monthly efficiency rating and im putting you in the top ten now you dont want to louse yourself up do you
i dont care if it is marilyn monroe im already in bed and ive taken a sleeping pill so im afraid the answer is no
buddyboy she wont keep that long not even on ice listen kid i cant pass this up she looks like marilyn monroe
im sorry mr dobisch you know i like to help you guys out but its sort of late so why dont we make it some other time
thats okay buddyboy now like i was saying im in this joint on sixtyfirst and i think i got lucky shes a skater with the ice show and i thought maybe i could bring her up for a quiet drink
oh yes mr dobisch i didnt recognize your voice

oh our friend from the chinese restaurant thanks fran we better keep it here
merry christmas
its christmas eve fran lets not fight
how could i be so stupid youd think i would have learned by now when youre in love with a married man you shouldnt wear mascara
okay okay fran i deserve that but just ask yourself why does a man run around with a lot of girls because hes unhappy at home because hes lonely thats why all that was before you fran ive stopped running
and just think right now theres some lucky girl in the building whos going to come after me
now fran
i was never very good at history let me see there was miss olsen and then there was miss rossi no she came before it was miss koch who came after miss olsen
is that whats been bothering you miss olsen thats ancient history
funny thing happened to me at the office party today i ran into your secretary miss olsen you know ringadingding i laughed so much i like to died
well thats more like it at least youre speaking to me
yeah thats me the happy idiot a million laughs
come on fran dont be like that you just going to sit there and keep bawling you wont talk to me you wont tell me whats wrong look i know you think im stalling you but when youve been married to a woman for twelve years you dont just sit down at the breakfast table and say pass the sugar and i want a divorce its not that easy anyway this is the wrong time the kids are home from school my in laws are visiting for the holidays i cant bring it up now this isnt like you fran you were always such a good sport such fun to be with
i promise
where are we going jeff not back to that leaky boat
i love you remember
i have that date remember
fran
you know i do
im sure if youll just tell me that you still love me
are you sure thats what you want
of course not you had nothing to do with it
lets get something straight jeff i never asked you to leave your wife
what do you think

i saw my lawyer this morning i wanted his advice about the best way to handle it
okay im sorry
if youll just listen to me for a minute
i wasnt trying

sorry mr sheldrake im full up youll have to take the next elevator
i want you back fran
why do you keep calling me jeff what do you want from me
how do you think i felt riding home on that sevenfourteen train
for a while there you try kidding yourself that youre going with an unmarried man then one day he keeps looking at his watch and asks you if theres any lipstick showing then rushes off to catch the sevenfourteen to white plains so you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee and you sit there by yourself and you think and it all begins to look so ugly
i never said goodbye fran
look jeff we had two wonderful months this summer and that was it happens all the time the wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist or the elevator girl comes september the picnic is over goodbye the kids go back to school the boss goes back to the wife and the girl they dont make these shrimp like they used to
i dont believe you
lets not start on that again jeff please im just beginning to get over it

you know what i
hey ive got a great compliment for you
melvin even though it may seem that way now you dont know me all that well im not the answer for you
im feeling ive been feeling better
okay
if you need an excuse theres a bakery on the corner theres a shot itll open soon that way were not screwy were just two people who like warm rolls
see its four in the morning a walk sounds a little screwy to me if you dont mind
it feels a little confined here lets take a walk
maybe we could live without the wise cracks
oh come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you
boyfriend
it relaxes me id feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else i can think of or imagine
because
i had to see you
is it a secret what youre doing here
what a break
i wasnt asleep
what are you doing here
were you asleep
what job
cause of being woken up and it would make my job impossible so then i wouldnt even try
grouchy
cause if you were asleep im sorry and you could be grouchy
what do you want
were you asleep
what do you want melvin
so long
okay goodbye
i shouldve danced with you
go ahead
okay to say something now
you dont have to answer everything i say just listen to me okay
cute
see theres an example i dont know whether youre being cute or crazy now
the two might go together
i dont know whether im being sensible or hard on you
that seems like a good choice
i can trust my brain
how you doing
yeah well
hello
i dont care what you did for me i dont think i want to know you anymore all you do is make me feel badly about myself you have my number
ill take you why not
ill take a bus
here are the keys to my apartment im going to park you in my place while i take carol home
its your car but i dont want to hear it if that means anything
this one has a special meaning
i dont
what do you mean you said you liked it
i dont want to hear that music right now
do it then get the dog picked up i cant believe you let it stay there
let me see ahh gorgeous
nothing like no choice to make you feel at home
to hell with sex
sorry didnt realize she was right there did you have sex with her
it was a mistake
ill never forget you said it
i dont know why i brought you that idea occurred to me is all it came out first hey you kiss him me he says he loves you you two hit it off but you dont want to fine forget what i said about sex with simon it was a mistake
thats why you brought me look at me is that really why you brought me like im a what and i owe you what
its one idea
sex with simon
there are lots of reason i had a thought that if you had sex with simon it might
if you ask me ill say yes
tell me even if youre scared tell me why you wanted me here its okay
well ah thats a personal question
that wasnt payment when you first came into breakfast when i saw you i thought you were handsome then of course you spoke so now that your soft lil underbelly is all exposed tell me why did you bring me
you dont owe me that
heres the trouble with never
never
have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid
takes months to know they work little by little talking like this is exhausting
so how are you doing with those pills well i hopahopahopa
then ive really overshot here cause i was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out
thats maybe the best compliment of my life
i dont quite get how thats a compliment for me
dont be pessimistic its not your style okay here i goes clearly a mistake i have this what ailment and my doctor a shrink who i used to see all the time he says or percent of the time a pill can really help i hate pills very dangerous things pills hate i am using the word hate about pills my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how youd never well you were there you know the next morning i started taking these pills
i am so afraid youre about to say something awful
one baked one fries
fries
two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer baked or fries
can we order first
and mean it
okay
thats not compliment melvin thats just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid a compliment is something nice about somebody else now or never
that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away never fails
melvin pay me a compliment i need one and quick you have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings
no wait what why i didnt mean it you gotta sit down you can still give me the dirty look just sit down and give it to me
no i dont get this place they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress i dont get it
and
ive been thinking about that since you brought it up before
you wanna dance
you promised a nice place cant you just you have these dry cleaned all the time dont you
no im not wearing that and just in case you were going to ask im not going to let you inject me with plaque either
just him and thats it okay you can answer weve worked it out
stop asking everyone
dancing
my son was outside playing soccer i never saw him playing ball come on you guys take me out for a good time take me out dancing
yes sure ill take the sofa
no answer maybe we should just drive there tomorrow can i have that one
no
thats not true some of us have great stories pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad just not anybody in this car but lots of people thats their story good times and noodle salad and thats what makes it hard not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good
go ahead simon your father walked in on you and was yelling and really come on
my father didnt leave his room for years he hit my hand with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano
you like sad stories you want mine
hey you let him
anybody here whos interested in what melvin has to say raise their hands
nonsense
im sure simon they did something real off for you to feel this way but when it comes to your partners or your kid things will always be off for you unless you set it straight maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance
welcome

its not only financial assistance what hes got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money its not going to happen on the phone
concerned im just the hall monitor here
yeah but its all about simon now you helped with the dog and now there are other things im just as concerned as you are about simon
about a dog
hey you called me i
what look at you you sense a mark
what
it looks like it really went over youre sure making the rounds simon says you brought him soup last night i hope he doesnt write you a note
really nice shouldnt that be a good thing telling someone no thanks required
shes nice
do it
i did and his stomach is out of whack so they need him for a couple of days
sure take him to the vet
its not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind but he did throw up twice and his spark is off
okay by me
no he wants him back hell be by tomorrow
its been five weeks another few wont kill me
simons home i was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until hes had a chance to think and adjust
hes a pain in the ass
hows verdell doing
you dont want to mess with me today ill figure something else out tomorrow
hey where are you going you cant do this i cant take a dog nobodys ever been in here before
thanks for looking after him
im not saying nothing to you
youre taking him yes youre taking him this will clear the books one night you want to say no to me try because ive never felt as nuts as i do right this second i almost want you to try saying no
shhhh now i like simon i like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again meanwhile ill try and think how you can make this up to him i hate doing this im an art dealer have a nice day party
police police fucking crooked police doughnutmunching morons help me assault and battery and youre black
you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude but i grew up in hell my grandmother had more attitude you dont intimidate me
no touch no touch no touch
hope you find him i love that dog
definitely a package you dont want to open or touch
what i know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me i dont give a fuck what or where you shove your show are we being neighbors for now
simon youve got to get dressed
no its all right ill just watch
shall i get her for you
wait here
actually i dont think so
they require a tie and jacket but we have some available
what
yes we do and i can give you a tie and jacket
hi you have hard shells right
good evening
ill be able to keep my apartment and studio wont i just tell me
frank loves you you know that but ive spoken to him and he feels that as a businessman with limited resources
well i cant reach them
the medical bill are thousand now ive spoken to your parents and they didnt hang up or anything they just said they would feel strange calling you
see hes right i need the cards simon youre broke
terrify me
franks idea he thought i should have notes so i did this right maintained focus didnt get emotional and tried not to terrify you
sorry what are those cards
you little stinker hes given you everything
no please dont force him
i havent looked at myself yet i figured i could tell from your reaction
how you doing great one
whered they teach you to talk like this some panama city sailor want to humphump bar or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey sell crazy some place else were all stocked up here
youre a wonderful man two oclock is a good time heres the key in case hes asleep open the curtains for him so he sees gods beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best
sure thing
not just today uh could you do it until until he gets back on his feet
absolutely
no would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him
is he dead yet
we will if we can and if we cant well come back and ask you again and again
ask him
oh is he dead
just move on no one here killed him
what
how come youre pretending to do cop work cause i dont think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole
okay so you call and dont leave your name even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name how come you make a mistake like that
i forgot to lock the door
whats wrong
okay thanks a lot here i go
then get in your jammies and ill read you a story i think youve got a chance the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever so go catch her off guard
hey im charged here but she might kill me for showing up this late
you know who you want ill take your seat any day so do something dont sleep on it go over there i dont think anybody should ever sleep on anything its not always good to let things calm down
absolutely not
but you know where youre lucky
well if thats true then im really in trouble
picking on me wont help
it was better than this look you im very intelligent if youre going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope you got to be better than youre doing if you cant be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up im drowning and youre describing water
did you like it that much
i dont know let me sleep on it and figure it out because im stuck cant go back to what i had shes evicted me from my life
okay you tell me why youre dying here
no and youre supposed to be sensitive and sharp
because you love her
im a great guy extraordinary and she doesnt want contact with me im dying here
what did she say
im coming

look we both want the dog and
sorry didnt know you were awake i just thought verdell shouldnt get too used to sleeping in here cause then
i love you
they did a nice job cozy huh
thank you melvin you overwhelm me

melvin
do you ever get an erection for a woman
not at all huh lets go to the hotel and if youre lucky tomorrow dad will give you another wad of sweaty money
not it at all really
this stuff is pointless
well i always painted always and my mother always encouraged it she was sort of fabulous about it actually and she used to i was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it and she was very natural she used to pose nude for me and i thought or assumed my father was aware of it
never a break never
thats very thoughtful
lets do the small talk in the car load up
i uh i was attacked walked in on people robbing me i was hospitalized i almost died
yeah
but sick nauseous where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches when you can barely get up the will to complain
i havent been sleeping i havent been clear or felt like myself im in trouble some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back but the tiredness boy not just sleepy
got any easier questions
i have never been so tired in my life okay if i sit here

well i work all the time so never never again interrupt me okay i mean never not years from now not if theres fire not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later theres a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think youre going to faint even then dont come knocking or if its election night and youre excited and want to celebrate because some fudgepacker you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states and hes going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone dont knock not on this door not for anything got me sweetheart
no actually i even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden

love was
mr udall id like to talk to you please
franks shows my work mr udall i think you know that
howre you doing
frank sachs melvin udall
like thick molasses with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food
which color was that
i got it youre talking about your dog i thought that was the name of the colored man ive been seeing in the hall
my dog you know i mean my little dog with the adorable face dont you know what my dog looks like
whats he look like
mr udall excuse me hey there have you seen verdell
i think of a man and take away reason and accountability
how do you write women so well
aw come on just a couple of questions how hard is that
oh god this is like a nightmare
that somebody out there knows what its like to be in here
whats it mean
i cant resist you usually move through here so quickly and i have so many questions i want to ask you you have no idea what your work means to me
no no no hey that painting in there i just want to tell you
why are you doing this
please no
just a second he has to go
wait i want to see the painting
yes well theres one more stage trying to figure out if its any good
so youre practically finished huh
no okay what i do is watch and wait for um you ever watch someone who doesnt know youre watching an old woman on a bus kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external that its in respond to a private thought they just had they are just sort of realer and more alive and when you notice it so are you if you look at someone long enough you discover their humanity
the fact that you havent said hold it means i havent done it right is that correct i havent done it right
nothing i just watch till something strikes me do anything you think of try different thing until i say hold that pose then just try and comfortably hold it
how about that pose this is not fun give me some direction
exactly what is your previous experience
i insist it is the least we can do
thats okay i like the metro its only a couple of stops from here
yes you are free to go karel here will drive you home
we had a deal
good wait here it will not take long and then you may go
central station locker number combination jfk
release mr greenwells possessions
yeah
would you like your things now
you may use my office
ill need to make a phone call
you have the letter and my word if you wish you may wait upstairsnow where are the disks
how do i know this isnt a trap
i have the directors word there will be no action against them you may go once we have the disks
and the students
the choice is yours its not negotiable
im not sure its possible
first i want to walk free with a letter in english from the prosecutor general dropping all charges second i want two first class tickets to london leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope lastly all actions against the students are to be stopped
what is it you want
i didnt get to see whats on the disks but i can guess do you want to hear my terms or not
you are playing a very dangerous game i suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are
not all of them
good try mr greenwell but a little late we have analyzed the contents of that drum the remains of the disks are there just as you said
i lied to you i didnt destroy the floppy disks
really
thanks but i dont intend to stay
well have to see what more we can do for you while you are still our guest
no
enjoying our hospitality
either youre a liar or you are a fool
a kind of freedom
what was the real purpose behind this venture
it was the biggest i could find
why did you break into that particular building
fuck you
you will wish you hadnt
thats right
and you broke into that room
yes they had nothing to do with it
this is your doing
alright ill see to it and thingsll be just as they were okay
yes if you can get him free
will you come home and forget all about him
you really are a piece of work you know that you walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up
josh i need your help dougs been arrested hes in big trouble i thought maybe your father and the embassy might be able to do something
so what have you got to say for yourself was he good in bed
can we talk in your office
of course darling youd like to apologise
josh i have to speak you its urgent
honey what a pleasant surprise sorry to keep you waiting
dont you dare ill be back
shall i look after the rest
yeah and youre a slut so what
you bastard
its more than what youre worth
go to hell
thats my bag
leave me just leave me alone josh
come on holly
its time to go home holly
i dont want to go
why
well for a start youve got to get cleaned up
what for
i think we should be going honey
okay honey but dont be long i got plans
later
yeah so i hear dont you think you should go get changed
well come on sit down
josh
see you brought one of the patients with you too
i decided to help out at the asylum
oh thats it everything i do is crap
all im saying honey is run the thing past me for christs sake before you get up and broadcast the crap
maybe it is
shit honey you couldve told me people might think its about us
just yesterday
when the hell did you write that
subtitles you have made many mistakes pavel let there be no more for your sake
very well
delay mr greenwells departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me then have one of your officers drive him home ill see to the rest
it was all on a russian format i dont think that would be so easy we must take that chance
what if his accomplices have made copies
all the more reason to eliminate him
and there has been enquiries from the american embassy maybe they are involved
i dont care about americans arrest them all if you have to but keep those records secret
and what of these foreigners
that was not my decision i can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored in the meantime no one else must know those files exist secure the building and i will arrange alternative safe storage immediately
it was crazy not to have destroyed them
i dont think you realise what will happen if those files are made public the lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records including your own now
i dont understand it there were a lot of people there last night many americans i believe we should move carefully
have you lost all control of this city
some americans
so who is in the building
yes i think so it is still barred but it is not the university who are in the building
the university cannot do this is the room safe
the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed
what are you an idiot
were not sure
you are responsiblewhat has happened
the storage facility will be ready within a week ill call you then
the files are in a sealed room and the university are under strict orders to stay away
you are quite sure its secure
in a building belonging to the university in the old town
you know everyone can be controlled pavel where are you storing the personnel files
this press we cannot control americans i think
why are there still such headlines
i do
and i have no idea why
no youre with who you should be its like she chose you
im sorry about how we
pictures from the play jamie looks pretty
ill tell her you were here
she asleep
because she doesnt know what a hint is

here why am i looking at this star
sure
can you locate xxii
me
whats the best thing i can see tonight
im always home by midnight and hes always asleep
what about your father
ergo
no why are you seducible
are you trying to seduce me
hoped for it
you planned this
a thermos of hot coffee a blanket socks
mars doesnt rise until
mars
so what do you want to see
in my back yard i lied before its hardly started but when its done it will have twice the power of this one
wheres the one youre building
its an altazimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one
i was twelve
when did you build this
the truth i just left you out of it
whatd you tell your father
look talk not talk
what would you do up here
from here he proved to me the earth isnt flat on rainy days wed be above the clouds
before the divorce my father used to take me here fire spotting was his summer job
how do you know this place
away from here
where
come on
the challenger exploded principal kellys about to make an announcement
whats wr
twice a year
assholes this happen to you
that and less strange
loved
you make me feel
not possible
i might do it wrong
maybe youre not supposed to
i dont understand
wonder beauty joy love
what do you actually know with religion
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable
we can measure wind
im sure pretty sure
youre sometimes not sure
its places like this that make me certain theres a god
youre straddling the state line youre in two places at once
youre acting like a crazy person
where
stand right here
that whats happening to you only faster
the cells in our bodies are always changing in six or seven years all your cells have changed you could be like a completely new person from the inside out
fun
excuse me
what are you talking about
its about working with what you already have right now at your fingertips you know spontaneously
before we do this i just want to say that a good lifes gotta be about more than achieving stuff like on your list
were doing something
before we do this
i know you want to
no
your turn
were going somewhere after and no i didnt ask your father
its only
i have to get you home by one
is there a rush
i wanted this to be a date
i cant believe you asked my fathers permission
im not allowed to date
why not
yes but not as a date date
you
what
like fire
no but are you impressed
why are you doing all this to impress me
she great or what
i heard what you did thank you
hey
it means you can do anything
what does that mean
when i have something to say
so youre talking to me
yeah with a finish in about a decade
its a start
because then you couldnt hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your god
and why would that scare me
you dont either take a look at yourself maybe youre scared that someone might actually like you
you dont know what you want
i dont want to be just your friend
you dont know the first thing about being someones friend
okay maybe some of that is true
prove it
its not
all of it
that sounds like horseshit
maybe you inspire me
and that would ruin your reputation how
people can see
youre hardly nice to anyone
i havent been nice to you
thank you so were you
you were great the other night
healthy as can be
he okay
then maybe you can read mine
thats it exactly youre reading my mind
so its like you want to be secret friends
that would be the reason
belindas a very jealous person
or anywhere where people might see us
yeah
oh just not at school
yes and
the plays in a couple of weeks
you dont miss a thing
youre not in a very good mood
im really glad you think so
the plays going to be really good
sometimes i dont even trust me
he doesnt trust you
your father doesnt like me
interpreted by another guy like my father
the bible why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles
you dont believe in anything
you have to believe to have faith
there is no point you live you die the end
i know theres a plan for everyone but sometimes i dont understand what the message is or what the point is
no
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do
like in a church painting i see this giant hovering over the ground hes wearing a robe and has long flowing hair and hes pointing his finger at something
dont you
but you think about him it her
my relationship with god is my own
yeah
in ten words or less
youre really into god right
in years me neither
yeah im probably not going to be around next time it comes
the dirty snowball at its core
im building a larger one to see the nucleus of haleys comet
i hope so i think maybe she sees me now
do you believe youll see your mother again
looking for something someone
looking for intelligent life
or building blocks for a world that never formed
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart
but there are thousands of them made of floating ice
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings
saturn beautiful
that is my telescope
what is that
could be
the world of the dead
cuz its dark and quiet and you can see into another world
do you think im strange
yeah maybe i dunno
because i try to be nice to people
know so
you think so
hes a softy got him wrapped around my finger
i know dont say anything
dont bother
ill get something for us to drink
and you have to meet my father
no problem
i do know be two places at once learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel eat breakfast with chopsticks
like youd know
ambitious
spend a year in the peace corps make a medical discovery
get very wasted lose your virginity
you want to tell me
its private
so what else is on this list
its like a todo list but for my life
go for it
ill take a chance
maybe a little of both
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know
you got some kind of list
good thing
the reason i got the part im a little like lizzie except i dont worry about some man rescuing me
kinda yeah
im an enemy
is do something illegal is befriend an enemy
whats with the friggin numbers
so you agree you need help
what the
no not like you
like me
fire is like a living thing wild unpredictable
because thats where the fire is
why
yeah
then we both know ill point you drive faster
i know you dont want help
my act
your act only works with an audience
thats deep
i know you dont suck at acting
this play
this play means a lot to me
youre like this fly buzzing buzzing everywhere
yes youreyoure bb beautiful
is it really me
believe in yourself and they will let me ask you lizzie look in the mirror are you pretty
they wont
i hope your dreams come true
good cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person
i dont want to have any conversation
cant you have a normal conversation
like what the moons of jupiter
you mean care what you say im worrying about other things
i wear the sweater because im cold i read because no one talks to me my hair is my hair what is it exactly thats bothering you
your book and your brown sweater and your hair whats more to know
you dont know me

antidote to what whose disguises
its an antidote a formula whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises
its your hand buckaroo
ever since that phony phone call from the president look at this what is it
im a giant semiconductor and theres alien creatures all around us form the eighth dimension i think look
what
carefuldont make noise and dont touch me im hotter than flapjacks
buckaroo what the sam hill
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part right professor
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces
im assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock just in case
rawhide tells me dr lizardo escaped
buckaroo ive done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft
smells fermented check in with the institute reno see if everythings kosher

buckaroo somebody shanghaied the professor
thats me ive been ionized but im okay im switching on the homing beacon mark two minute intervals
and try the presidents private number at the hospital make sure this is on the level were busy people here
go back to the bus and reroute the call
he went on a senseless crime spree killed a cop during a bank robbery got caught and judged insane the professor told us they threw away the key
and his soul black as the ace of spades
the professor and dr emilio lizardo were actually the first to discover the eighth dimension almost fifty years ago before buckaroos parents even knew each other but there was trouble a rocket catapult failed and dr lizardo got sucked half in half outwhen they hauled him back he wasnt the same guy his hair was orange
first thing i did
have you warned professor hikita
dr lizardos a raving lunatic perfect tommy a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours
vanished thin air
then what
same one you had yesterday
got a half a tuna sandwich
im starvingsomebody help
new jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire quite a guy if you want my opinion
all accounted for wheres penny
whorfin does he know were coming

sams dead someone broke into the jet car and things are going haywire over at the lab
what is it tommy
buckaroo sorry

what is this thing a fighter
they will never surrender they will fight to the end
these antidote filters the professors whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday as arachtoidal creatures they wont be pretty nothing personal john parker but just rememberif we fail tonight theres no tomorrow
and ask the american taxpayer to foot the bill no way send em back to the eighth dimension as soon as we find the overthruster it wasnt in pennys purseso if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out
just their side whatre we gonna do with these people theyre illegal aliens the way i figure been here forty years you could throw the book at em
got a casualty list
john parker tell them were doing our best stall
theyre armed for bear buckaroo check out those radiation levels
dont shoot
and they got penny look
to get my guns
wherere you goin

but he wasnt the real doctor lizardojust this arachtoid creep that stole the good docs body the year before in the eighth dimension when prof hikitas lab exploded
orson wells what about doctor lizardo
where there was some kinda giant crash landing a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for

its got to be tiring to beat that machine
im tired
thanks

you still get the pleasure didnt you ever fuck anybody else while you were married nick
even though you were fucking him
thats right
because you didnt love him
no
but you didnt hurt

i loved him i hurt
how did you feel when he died
ive got a degree in psych it goes with the turf games are fun
you like playing games dont you
yes it does doesnt it
writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him
no i said i liked johnny to use his hands i dont give any rules nick i go with the flow
but you said you liked men to use their hands
i have nothing to hide
i told them you wouldnt want to hide
i told them you wouldnt want an attorney present

you fell in love with her first
things change anyway you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in maxine
once this was a relationship based on love now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head

itll never happen fuckface
it was lovely being you being malkovich my dear id never seen the passionate side of sweet maxine before or her actual tits for that matter if only ive been thinking to myself if only i could actually feel what malkovich feels rather than just see what he sees and then dare i say it if only i could control his arms his legs his pelvis and make them do my bidding

i said yes
yex

mr juarez

welcome to lestercorp may we meet your filing needs
i am not alone there are others we are legion you will pay for this blasphemy you will pay dearly
youre insane
there are rules boy procedures etiquette this is not a toy ive been waiting seventy years to utilize this room grooming myself quietly setting the stage performing ablutions paying tribute seeing all his motion pictures again and again worshipping schwartz worshipping properly
dr lester i dont know what youre talking about
youre making a big mistake schwartz maam
the vacant office i see olive oil interesting be warned schwartz there are certain doors which should never be opened
uh importexport olive oil right on actually in the vacant office so well still be seeing each other
and what sort of business will this be if you dont mind my asking
no sir not at all its just that im going to open my own business and
i see are you unhappy at our little company
no thank you sir its delicious though i just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at lestercorp but im afraid im going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately
more beetspinach juice my friend
dr lester
thank you sir
ah yes the little door there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes if you hurry youll just make it
dr lester i have a question i was in that vacant office down the hall and i stumbled upon a little door and
ah craig just the fellow i wanted to see juicer easy as pie just keep your fingers clear of the blade and never never use it while bathing in a tub full of water
dr lester
thats sounds fine sir gotta run
shall we say dinner on friday just the two of us you can come too if you like schwartz
yessir
wife huh id love to meet her craig
dr lester its been really fascinating but im afraid i have to get home to my wife now
imagine a room full of women nubile blonde wet with desire schwartz a harem if you will me in leather a harness if you like i am the object of this desire and all eyes are on me as i speak ladies i begin i am the love god eros i intoxicate you my spunk is to you manna from heaven
all right meet me at the juicyjuice juice bar after work today and ill spill my goddamn guts for you
dr lester while i am flattered that you share your feelings with me i believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion
i dont want to be your godamn link damn you i want to feel floris naked thighs against my own i want to know passion i want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful complex woman i want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when i penetrate her oh god the agony of the flesh schwartz
the elderly have so much to offer sir they are our link with history
no sirebob i dont die but what i do is get older wrinkled like a former plum thats become the wrinkled prune you see before you oh to be a young man again maybe then floris would care for me
ill keep that in mind sir
one hundred and five carrot juice lots of it i swear its almost not worth it i piss orange oh and i have to piss sitting down like a godamn girly every fifteen minutes but nobody wants to die schwartz
i wasnt toying with her sir i was just how old are you
dont toy with floris schwartz why if i were eighty years younger id box your ears
low overhead mboy we pass the savings on to you but seriously thats all covered in orientation
just one why is this floor so short
thank you for being kind enough to lie you see ive been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech youre hired any questions
no i understand perfectly
pity it tells it like it is thats why the eastern read jewish publishing establishment wont touch it thats a quote from the book jacket george will i think i apologize if you cant understan a word im saying dr schwartz
no
flattery will get you everywhere my boy but im afraid i have to trust floris on this one you see she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western perhaps youve read her memoirs i cant understand a word any of you are saying
you dont have a speech impediment dr lester
damn you are good i tried to trick you okay put these in order
glooph is not a letter sir
you think so eh which comes first l or glooph
well sir im an excellent filer
tell me dr schwartz what do you feel you can bring to lestercorp

no its okay sir just a mixup with your secretary
security

youre evil maxine
you picked the unrequited variety very bad for the skin
i dont think so ive fallen in love this is what people whove fallen in love look like
ive fallen in love

youre late
so unbolt the fucking door einstein
this is amazing were gonna be rich
my god
craig i just dont find you attractive and lotte im smitten with you but only when youre in malkovich when i looked into his eyes last night i could feel you peering out behind the stubble and the tooprominent brow and the male pattern baldness i sensed your feminine longing peering out and it just slew me
sounds good oblique but intriguing phone it in

exactly two hundred dollars a pop
tickets to malkovich
good well sell tickets
yes of course hes a celebrity
is this malkovich fellow appealing
lots of things hes very well respected that jewel thief movie for example the point is that this is a very odd thing supernatural for lack of a better word it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self about the existence of the soul am i me is malkovich malkovich was the buddha right is duality an illusion do you see what a can of worms this portal is i dont think i can go on living my life as i have lived it theres only one thing to do lets get married right away
whats he been in
hes an actor one of the great american actors of the th century
sounds delightful who the fuck is john malkovich
theres a tiny door in that empty office its a portal maxine it takes you inside john malkovich you see the world through john malkovichs eyes then after about fifteen minutes youre spit out into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike
it better be
this is important

listen im craig schwartz just starting out at lestercorp
well truth is for suckers isnt it
is that true
yes unfortunately its bullshit the real story of is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors
moving story
fine your mails on the kitchen table mostly junk oh theres a letter from alex trebek
fine im not mad lets just drop it
fine i mean its not like i was doubting you its just that i know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire
fine lets drop it
i was just asking no disrespect intended
i am the devil lester i think i can handle it
can you do that i mean do you know anything about puppetry
well if mantini wins schwartz will leave malkovich right so if he needs it i help mantinis performance a bit give him an edge spice up the show
i missed you im sorry tell me the plan
why are you being like this
do tell i love a good plan
but i think i have another plan
oh hes good great actually i saw him do tru with his sixty foot robert morse puppet sensational
no the mediocre mantini of course the great mantini
the great mantini
maxine says shell leave him if he leaves malkovich plus hes been challenged to a puppetduel by mantini
what kind of circumstances
no for gods sake i just watered it yesterday it almost went well i gave a pretty good dream but circumstances arose
howd it go did you say the philodendron gets water or no
i like that
no a sexy dream of course a scary dream
a scary dream
i suppose i could come to him in a dream i dont know thats the best i can think of right now
very talented son of a bitch too bad we cant kill him
impressions those are hard
the kids got talent youve never seen malkovich like this schwartz had him up there singing and dancing impressions
vegas whatd you think
we saw his show at the luxor last night
have a seat i wracking my brain over this malkovich thing
look im going back to my house to ponder this so stay calm and keep track of schwartzs comings and goings oh and somebody dispose of schwartzs wife will you nice to meet you all
didnt mean to imply that you were sir
right lester i heard you the first time im not a dummy
and as i said sir we cant very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich
boy this is a toughie to be honest i didnt anticipate this

count me in
but of course
do we get to wear a crown
anybody else
lots of carrot juice little lady that and a deal with the devil
you dont look a day over one hundred and five captain whats your secret
im afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel
that bastard ill gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich
im not certain my dear but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route
why not i need to get in there
thank you all for your efforts but im afraid we can no longer get into malkovich through the portal
i understand but we must protect the vessel at all costs please craig please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours
its craig in there i can tell
no dont harm the vessel
you bastard
aaaahhhh the portal
oh sorry right this way
no
oh didnt anyone show you the indoctrination video
no i didnt know that
what that is not allowed my god you are supposed to be one of us you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself
no you dont understand ive been inside malkovich when im with maxine
hmmm a lesbian are you i must inform you that i find that highly arousing
craig stole maxine from me dr lester
you know i think it pays to leave juicemaking to the trained professionals you look terrible my dear
my child i dont think its a great mystery what craigs up to
but now weve lost access to craig
you followed your heart my child and that is not necessarily a bad thing
i blew it dr lester
we need you on the inside my child to report on his comings and goings and if need be to destroy him for lack of a better word
but why son of malkovich
no you mustnt my child
im getting divorced
with immense pleasure my dear down that hall ninth door on the left watch the step down its sunken you know
dr lester would you point me toward the restroom
oh be still my heart
yes of course dr lester
tell me lotte can you understand a word im saying
who needs dancing
no
is there dancing
great then
im not afraid i toured for a year with the national puppet companys production of long days journey into night
nothing but acting to hide behind buddyboy
sounds boring are there any songs
broadways finest three hours its about the suppression of the individual conformity as god in modern society
never heard of it
say equus its got everything
whats the play
a friendly competition if you will your malkovich puppet and my harry s truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play not some vegas burlyq pyrotechnics but a real play that requires actual acting the audience decides who is more deserving of the title the losing puppeteer bows out graciously goes back to obscurity as a file clerk
how do we do that
well see schwartz well see
shes not available
because if you missed any i just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now
yeah i saw them
did you see the reviews
hello schwartz i saw your show
whatever
goodbye maxine
derek mantini
yeah what
perhaps youll want to consult that ouija board again
honey we can be happy and poor together
i just had the most horrifying nightmare the devil was in it
youve got to be kidding
ive got to leave malkovich
bad dream darling
busy day my little fire chief why dont you climb into bed and ill meet you there in just

whatever youre having
can i get you a drink
its just that i fantasize about you and well speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and
howd you get this number
you dont know me but im a great admirer of yours
whos calling
mr malkovich
yeah
thanks mister d
you did a good job charlie
i dont know
you think the das gonna file on joanne
take some time off
she kills the old man and makes it look like miss lawson did it pretty slick
under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing since rebecca lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will if she is found guilty the will is void and joanne braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated
what good does that do its the old will
here it is according to the old will joanne braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
what would joanne braslow need with an estate attorney she wasnt even mentioned in marshs will
joe koehler i know him hes an estate attorney and hes very expensive
joanne braslow is getting more and more interesting i followed her today to an attorneys office joseph koehler
right now guess whos been buying coke from him for the last five and half years
charlie are you going to make a point soon
you got something on the coke
im sorry to barge in but i figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news
because it hasnt all been erased
why
its very good because when the das office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape otherwise they would have buried it
so what good is it to us if its been erased
i would have missed it but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked it looks like blank tape but it isnt its been erased without any input signal coming in
no but i got something
you got something on the coke
ive been waiting for you to get back
im trying
youve got to get me something i can use charlie
before you ask theres nothing new on the coke
i want you to hit all the dealers in town give them a list of people close to marsh and see if any of them use then i want you to check out a doctor alan paley he lives up in roseburg
so where do we start
we have to find out who else would profit from marshs death and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal
im sorry man but i aint ever heard of no brother dying from gettin too much pussy
it couldve happened to anyone
yeah i hear they had em a real dog and pony show going on up there ill tell you sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me i mean did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that
fine charlie you familiar with the marsh case
how you doin mister d
thank you doctor mccurdy your witness
it would be the same as shooting a gun at him
what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to mr marsh and then induced him to make love
it would be an added stress to his heart
and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine
increase his heart rate
dr mccurdy what would cocaine do to someone in mr marshs condition
yes those of mr marsh and a thumb print of miss lawsons
your honor the state enters this evidence as exhibit a were any fingerprints found on the bottle
yes
is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand
we found a bottle of dristan nasal spray on the nightstand it was filled with water and cocaine mr marsh had a head cold at the time of his death i believe he wasnt aware that he was ingesting cocaine
then how did it get into his body
i dont think so the membrane in his nasal passage didnt show any sign of long time usage
so mr marsh used cocaine
we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood
what induced it
no
was the heart attack the result of natural causes
very poor he was suffering from severe arterial disease
what was mr marshs physical condition prior to his death
a massive cardiac arrest
doctor mccurdy what was the cause of death
can we put rebecca lawson at the scene
cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want
any prints on the nasal spray
we know marsh had a head cold we found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand the coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant but for a much shorter time hed keep using more and more never knowing what he was taking
what can we prove
yes
what are you saying henry that his girlfriend fucked him to death
but theres more
thats what my report will read
the official cause
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest
whatd he die of
marsh wasnt alone we found traces of sperm on the sheets the toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood
not sure ill have everything you need tomorrow
cause
about three hours
you get his statement
can i go
your honor im trying to establish a pattern in dr paleys behavior with women
objection may i remind mr dulaney that the person on trial here is miss lawson not dr paley
your honor im trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was
objection mr rostons sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial
ill rephrase the question mr roston isnt it true you are bisexual
objection
the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view
your honor mr roston lived with the defendant for many months i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson
objection the question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness
the states investigation just uncovered mr roston yesterday afternoon in chicago
your honor i dont see a mr roston listed as a prosecution witness
her its an obvious move im building a case against her remember
youve been following me
really what does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three oclock in the morning
you dont know what youre talking about
im talking to you as a friend now dont ruin your life your career for her shell spit you out when this is over
thats ridiculous
back off john
whats happening to you frank youre acting like youre on trial here this has become personal to you
i didnt hear it
hey the bells sounded its between rounds
ive got work to do
your honor please
im just curious to see if mr troxell reconstructed anything else
objection your honor the fact that mrs crawford heard mr troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesnt mean the incident never happened
i was just about to make my point your honor
your honor i fail to see what mrs crawfords educational background has to do with this case
objection your honor we dont know where this tape is from who made it or under what circumstances it was made
your honor this is a tape from miss lawsons answering machine i would like to play it now
yeah well well let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that
arent they all
shes innocent
then shes not as smart as i thought she was youve seen her in the depositions tell me you dont have any doubts
ill tell her but she wont take it
were going all the way on this one frank tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two fifteen to twenty five
i dont buy it and neither will a jury
the mes report stated that marshs nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her
suspicions maybe but suspicions arent enough for a conviction
because shes clever because she knows that even if we didnt find it wed have suspicions as to why a man in marshs condition would use cocaine
why would she want that
she planned this she wanted us to find the nasal spray
cmon think about it if she was going to kill marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find
youre bluffing john its me remember ive known you since your name was juan carlos
take your pole out of the water frank the fish aint biting today
can you
you cant show intent
marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will thats motive she admits to being there the night of his death thats opportunity and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle
lookin to make the papers john
no miss lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions she doesnt have to sit here and be insulted so either you charge her now or were leaving
sit down frank
thats it my client doesnt have to take this crap from you
thank you the state rests
she was
who was your primary beneficiary
yes
did you change your will while you were with miss lawson
i woke up the next morning and she was gone
what happened after that
i couldnt help myself you get lost inside a women like her it was like a drug it was the best sex i ever had
if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it
she started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me she reached down and put me inside her my doctor had warned me about exerting myself but you really dont think of those things at a moment like that you just think about how beautiful this woman is how much you want her how deeply you want to please her at first it started off slowly but the rhythm built and built every time i got close to an orgasm she would stop eventually i started to have trouble breathing rebecca just kept going faster and faster no matter what i said she wouldnt stop i really thought for a moment i was going to die
what did she do next mr roston
she said she was going to fuck me like ive never been fucked before
mr roston i know this is difficult for you but its important you tell the court what she did
what did she say
she told me that tonight we were going to open new doors i asked her to stop to take off the handcuffs but she wouldnt listen
shes a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality sometimes i felt she could read my mind it was uncanny how she knew exactly what i wanted a few nights before my heart surgery rebecca woke me she had handcuffed me to the bed
what would she do that made it hard to resist
its hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is
it was like sex was a game to her she got off on the control she always used to tell me it had to be her way
can you give the court an example
it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could she called it opening new doors
when you say your sexual relations with miss lawson were intense what exactly do you mean
well i think that after the operation she realized that
why do you think she left you
she didnt she just left
why did she say she was leaving
she left me
why not
it didnt
how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery
fine the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man
and how are you now
i had bypass surgery
what happened next
i had a bad heart
what kind of condition are you referring to
it was wild she was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up kinky things i tried to satisfy her the best i could but it was difficult in my condition
i know this is a very personal subject but could you be a little more specific
intense
how would you describe your sex life with miss lawson
for about one year
how long were you together
we were lovers
mr roston what was your relationship with miss lawson
i mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to im sure she didnt enjoy it
thats enough
im sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked
you called him
dont you see what shes doing she needs you to kill me shes planned it that way from the start thats why she phoned me tonight
thats all dr paley
i may have been infatuated with her but i wouldnt perjure myself
no further questions
you can suggest anything you want it happened
i suggest it never happened
no she asked me about cocaine
youre still angry arent you isnt it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at miss lawson
i was angry
youll be sorry
no
and after that didnt you continuously harass miss lawson
yes
and the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not
well as i remember it we had an argument
if necessary i can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence
no
you didnt grab her and try to kiss her
no
isnt it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot
we had dinner at a restaurant
dr paley where were you the last time you saw miss lawson
no no i dont
then you have no way of knowing what mr marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits
no
did miss lawson ever accompany mr marsh inside during his examinations
no
did mr marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness
no
dr trammel did you ever speak to miss lawson about mr marshs condition
yes quite easy
one last question doctor if someone didnt know better would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine
october twentyseventh
a previous witness stated that she saw miss lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on october twentyeighth according to your records when did you prescribe the drug
i tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water
how do you instruct your patients to take it
its a white powder that comes in a vial
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like
chinese peony root
what did you prescribe for her
yes
did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps
she suffers from severe menstrual cramps
why does she come to you
yes ive been seeing her for over a year
and is miss lawson a patient of yours
oriental medicine
dr wong what type of medicine do you practice
what else did the district attorneys office tell you to say
no
then those are not your own words
i heard him say it
no
high school
no
did you go to college mrs crawford
there was an inquiry it was his word against mine they believed him i was fired
what happened
while i was seeing dr paley i mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary three days after i spoke to him in his office he went to the head nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs
what happened next
do you remember his exact words
he laughed and basically said he would decide when it was over
what did he say
how
yes he did
did he make your life miserable
he used to call me tell me that i couldnt just walk out on him he said that if i didnt come back hed make my life miserable
and what did dr paley do after you stopped seeing him
i realized he wasnt serious he was seeing other women asking other nurses at the hospital out so i ended it
then what happened
we dated for about a month last year
what was the nature of your relationship with dr paley
im a nurse i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital dr paleys on staff there
where did you meet him
yes
miss sellers do you know dr alan paley
because he called me
then why did you go see mr koehler in the first place
no
you didnt know about it before that
to show you this its a letter from that lawyer koehler he wrote it to me the day after i saw him hes the one who told me i could get the money if miss lawson went to jail
whyd you come here
im gonna go to jail i know theyre gonna make it look like i did it they gotta put it on someone
what do you think ive got a gun maybe im gonna kill you too maybe ill blow your head off right now
what do you have in your purse
you killed him didnt you joanne
yes
then you would have gotten your money
you take what people say and make it ugly you make others believe what you want them to she should have been found guilty she shouldnt have gotten off
because you were jealous because he cut you out of the will because you have a cocaine habit to feed because you know that if rebecca lawson is found guilty the new will is void and theres a very good chance the old one would be honored
no why would i want to kill him
isnt it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle
no
isnt it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought
i dont know
you see thats what bothers me no other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house the police looked there was only the one bottle but you say you didnt arrive until after mr marsh was dead yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death how do you think it got there
pm
am or pm
three fifteen
would you read for us the time of the purchase
dristan nasal spray
theres an item you picked up thats marked will you read it
yes
well im a little confused this is a charge receipt from rosens drug store where mr marsh had an account its dated the day of the murder is this your signature
yes
yes
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money that must have made you pretty angry
she talked him into it she wanted everything
in his previous will mr marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars then he cut you out why do you think he did that
yes
and that he changed his will
yes
and that mr marsh paid less attention to you
yes
and you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you
yes
you resented the fact that she told you what to do in mr marshs house
yes
you dont like her because you were involved with mr marsh before she came along isnt that true
no
you dont like miss lawson much do you
ive been to a few yes
youve tried it isnt it true that youve been in and out of rehab centers for the last four years
ive tried it
money isnt the only reason people commit murder miss braslow
im a practical woman mr dulaney killing andrew wasnt in my best interest as it is im out of a job and im not in his will
i was jealous of course i was hurt he switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with but i didnt kill him
it must have been horrible having to go there seeing them together knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you
yes
youre lying marsh was wearing a cast on the tape it was right before he went to chicago and met miss lawson he dumped you for her didnt he
yes i slept with him but that was a long time ago
i thought he was a kind gentle man
that bastard
he video taped you
who told you that
yes i suppose its possible
well think about it isnt it possible
i dont know im not sure
so isnt it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didnt stop it was going to kill him that if she did leave his heart couldnt take it
i suppose
so the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving that must cause tremendous anxiety sleepless nights incredible stress
yes he mentioned it
didnt mr marsh also tell you that miss lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to chicago for awhile
he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him that his heart couldnt take it
could you repeat the last part of what mr marsh said to you the day before his death
yes it was on a friday i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday it would be october twentyeighth
do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial
how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom
i was at the house one morning i thought miss lawson was upstairs with mr marsh when i went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial
how do you know that
yes cocaine
what about miss lawson
no
did mr marsh use drugs
i wasnt lookin through the keyhole if thats what youre thinking id come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew id find their little toys all over the place
how do you know what kind of sex they had
andrew was a kind and gentle man but he was thirty years older than her wheres the attraction to sleep with someone like that to have the kind of sex they had
if you dont know her that well what makes you think shes capable of murder
i really dont know her that well we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house but that was about it
i take it you dont like miss lawson very much
i dont know its incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that but if anyone could it would be rebecca
you dont really believe what the district attorney is saying about miss lawson do you
he did look i know you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough and well
what changed
i worked for mr marsh for six years he was a good man until she came along
sorry
im not asking for names or specifics i just want to know what prompted you to make the call
you know i cant talk about that
i need to ask you a question what made you get in touch with joanne braslow
frank what are you doing here
hi joe
no further questions
yes
would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her
and she left shortly after that
yes
and didnt miss lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover
yes
and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson
yes
dont listen to him cant you see hes trying to turn you against me
hows it supposed to work rebecca you and paley celebrate your victory you get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you but then hes given himself away as your accomplice now he has to kill me after that i figure shell tell the police that you broke in that you were crazed because we humiliated you in court
no hes lying
shoot him
shes right paley youve got to kill me she doesnt have to shes free she cant be tried again but you you planned it with her you supplied the coke youre an accessory to murder
dont push me frank i might lose my temper and send it out just for spite
im not leaving without that tape
so sue me things have changed i think you should go home and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again
that wasnt the deal
ive been thinking about that ive decided to give it to you after ive collected the inheritance you can take that one if you want but theres another copy
thats crazy
you killed him you killed him and i got you off
frank its rebecca i need to see you right away ive got the tape
hello
no im a survivor
youre a monster
you can think whatever you want frank but i didnt kill andrew and im not going to prison for something i didnt do
no youre not
im dropping the case
i do need you no matter what you think of me i didnt do it
you dont need anybody
i knew you were thinking that i could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom youre wrong frank i need you to believe that
you killed him didnt you
youre too weak frank when you want something you have to do what ever it takes to get it if something gets in your way you remove it
he was only doing what he thought was right
fuck him he tried to shatter mine
rebecca we shattered a mans life in open court
to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today
whats that for
are you scared
what are you going you doing
tonight we open new doors
rebecca take these off
honey
sugar or honey
what does that mean youve been thinking about the case or you thought everything out before you killed marsh
dont worry about paley he cant touch me no one can ive thought it all out
im glad you have such confidence in me
im sure youll be able to handle him
paley could be a problem tomorrow
something wrong
you can see me now
can i see you later
its only the beginning
you were brilliant today
of course
alone
i went out on the boat
i called you all weekend where were you
i dont know frank but dont you think thats something we should find out
why would she lie
i dont use cocaine anymore if she says she saw me doing it shes lying
no i dont have to believe you the jury has to believe you and answers like hes lying or shes mistaken arent going to convince them
it isnt true you have to believe me
thats not good enough goddamit
shes mistaken
i just left joanne braslow she told me she saw you doing cocaine at marshs house
what
you lied to me
you take a lot for granted
theres nothing wrong in admitting that you want me frank
no thats what i know you were thinking
is that what you think i was thinking
you and me making love
what would
yes it would be nice
its hard to let go of a dream isnt it to let go of what you want
i broke my ankle skating that ended that dream
that seems so far away from who you are now what happened
yeah
really
no i wanted to be a professional hockey player
did you always want to be a lawyer
it wont be that hard
its going to be hard to convince a jury that hes testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off
i hardly know him he wanted me and he couldnt have me
tell me about doctor paley
its okay
sorry
andrew loved this old cabin he always dreamed about moving to tahiti living in a hut and becoming a beachbum i could never imagine myself doing that but somehow when he talked about it he made it sound so alive so wonderful soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets leaving the world and its problems behind i wish hed had a chance to do it
yeah
no not at the office ive got a better idea
great ill see you at the office at nine
yes she did
i just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow
hi frank
hi its frank
hello
not true shall i tell you what you were thinking you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt
nothing
tastes can change
its not my taste
thats not an answer
oh well theyre different
im the photographer
i think the photographers probably a voyeur
what do you think
no it just doesnt look right
is it against the law
because im your attorney i shouldnt be going to your house
why not
i know
this is your house
sure where to
can we get out of here
why didnt you live together
we started talking in fact we talked until four in the morning we discovered we shared a lot of the same interests after that we were together all the time until he left he used to call me every night after he came back then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him ive never left
and then
i was at a cocktail party very trendy andrew was in chicago on business he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling he looked so helpless
howd you meet marsh
because somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it
if you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard
when i was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard so did this family down the road i used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries it wasnt easy the stone walls were high and id scrape my knees as i climbed over on the other side were wild rose bushes the thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as i lowered myself down
try
because its beyond intellect its emotion its passion it has to be experienced it cant be imagined
why not
i dont know if its something i can explain to you
how
yes
as it pertains to you not me did you always know you had different tastes
i thought the subject was sex
i think were getting a little off the subject here
were not animals
something like that
no pain no gain
have you ever seen animals make love mr dulaney they have such passion such savage emotion they struggle and snarl and claw but neither hurts the other not really
i am who i am i cant deny it anymore than you can deny who you are i like sex different i like it wild thats not a crime i loved andrew we made love together we made it differently but we still made love it was our way it was private and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice if i was some middleaged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me
those same men will be sitting on the jury
im used to being on the outside looking in the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together
this is a very small town people here have very straight views on sex
andrew hardly needed leading he was a very passionate man he was eager to explore i gave him what he wanted we fulfilled each others needs
i want you to know right now that the trials going to be nasty your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud theyre going to say that you enticed marsh led him down a dark path
ill have you out in a few hours
frank
you still havent answered my question
hell file hes an ambitious man ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others
youre assuming the district attorney is going to file charges
and thats exactly what the jury will see when they look at me thats why i need a very good lawyer mr dulaney
not a very good one im afraid
you must have some feeling some immediate impression a young attractive woman involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will and the things that went on in that house such wild sex what kind of picture does that paint
i dont know thats why im asking you
do you think i did it
there are no charges against you im here to decide if im going to represent you should that occur did you kill him
are you going to represent me
shes waiting in the conference room
alright ill talk to her
well i guess that makes you the best look frank she stands to inherit three million dollars as executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us all im asking you to do is talk to her
raymond im the only criminal attorney you have
because i told her you were the best criminal attorney we have
why
i know but she wants you to represent her if cardenas files
im supposed to be on vacation
weve already got press arriving from over the country and she hasnt even been charged yet cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten id like you to go with her
andrew marsh was a very wealthy man a trial like this is going to put cardenas in the spotlight
i gotta go ill call you later
i know what day it is get off the phone
but its sunday
because im expecting a call
why
michael get off the phone
i love you too dad
i love you
is mom yelling at you too
well thats kind of how i am right now
yeah
you know how it is sometimes when youre out playing ball with your friends how youre really concentrating on what youre doing and you lose track of time and you come home late and mom yells at you
she allegedly humped him to death
hey you know better than that what did i teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something
the kids at school say she humped mr marsh to death
what are they saying
you better please answer the question
i can back it up
are you able to back up this allegation or are you fishing
your honor the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons mr marsh died how it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance
how often do you use cocaine
miss braslow id like to remind you that you are still under oath
mr roston
the witness will answer the question
mr cardenas i suggest you move on to another line of questioning
objection the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation
thats it mr dulaney take a seat
but your honor
maybe you dont know what its like where mrs crawford comes from but i do i came from a neighborhood just like hers this is a whole other world for her shes a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people so she puts on her best dress fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible being poor and having pride is not a crime mr dulaney and before you attempt to impeach another witness testimony in my courtroom your foundations better be based on something other than semantics
no your honor
mr dulaney before you cast aspersions on the district attorneys office by suggesting theyve coaxed this witness to say things that arent true you better have more than a hunch do you
discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities who told you to say that
do it quickly mr dulaney
is this what you want huh is it
frank stop it stop it
i dont want our lives ruined because of this i love you frank i want this to work but you have to help me you have to come back from where ever it is you are
you think thats the answer sex is that what you want you want me to make love to you
it was a place to start
its more involved than that
you used to like to touch me to make love to me
i dont know
why didnt you come to me
please not now
we cant pretend this isnt happening
you wouldnt like what youd see you dont know me anymore i dont know me anymore
talk to me
i know
maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael
i was thinking that when the trial is over wed all go skiing for a weekend
its bad enough that you are its even worse that you can stand here and lie to me
no
youre sleeping with her arent you
im not
this isnt a courtroom dont try to turn this around on me
because i knew youd think exactly what youre thinking
why did you lie to me
yes
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you you were with her werent you
working charlie and i were going over some statements
where have you been
sharon its late can we get to the point
thats what i was hoping youd tell me
whats wrong
we have to talk
yeah what are you doing up
yeah fine excuse me ill be right back
is that alright frank
no ones asking you not to work i just think you could make some time for your son
because i go to trial in seven weeks ive got a lot of preparing to do
why dont you talk to him now
ill talk to him later
frank i know youre busy but michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him he wanted to know why you werent talking to him
i can think of worse ways to go
yes
humped
yeah but can she cook
she sounds like quite a woman
attractive bright distant charming when she wants to be
whats she like
i dont know yet i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow
if he files are you going to take the case
he must have something or he wouldnt be pressing so hard
how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults
some example you set
i swear the both of you some example you set
he could let you have your vacation
i know what can i do he is the boss
were supposed to go to the lake
hello hi raymond what well i was sort of planning on alright okay goodbye that was sattler he thinks the das going to file on rebecca lawson he wants me in the office tomorrow morning
no it has to be done by tomorrow
cant it wait
im always open to learning new things
if you want me to
and i suppose youre going to show me how to relax
really
really
this is not relaxing
i am relaxing
youre on vacation remember youre supposed to be relaxing
i said no
well i can help
well theres a lot of boring stuff to do lists of people we have to write to find mamas relatives addresses in italy stuff like that
i dont mind waiting
why are there two deeds here
its a beautiful picture of her
doesnt matter move on
maybe its an italian thing their mother was italian
were not doing it im not even sure its christian
not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business
well no one in my family did dad bought cemetery plots at oak ridge one for him one for mom
my jewish friends grandmother did
i simply can not stand that tone
oh jesus
you said it in that tone like you were angry at me my brother at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch
so
well why dont i just say black so you can say white dont be surprised to find your brother hasnt changed an iota he hardly ever talks and when he does its in that tone you should have heard him at lunch not two words until the bill came and then he says worth every penny
its not that long
well thats a long time
we were here two christmases ago
boy it sure has been a long time
then we should have had lunch at the bank
michael doesnt understand people who make the kind of money my brother makes dont carry money on them they keep it all in various accounts
i nearly died when we split the bill
no we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife she told me all the dirt i forgot how interesting things can get around here it was so good to see them the last time we visited they were in europe he is doing so well he ordered champagne for lunch i nearly died
youre right that is sick
what about me i feel really weird like she cheated on me not dad isnt that sick i dont mean i wanted to sleep with her or anything but ya know being the only son youre sort of made to feel like youre the prince of the kingdom ya know and in the back of your mind you kind of think your mother doesnt need sex anymore because she has you
for over twenty years because thats what i was taught you stick with it normal people dont get divorced i cant remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to europe for christs sake quite frankly i dont think he ever did and now i find out in between bake sales my mother was anais nin
carolyn
what gets me is im years old ive been in this crummy fucking marriage
only about a thousand times what do i do now whats good enough for mom is good enough for me
did we want to
everything was during betty god we were so young why did we think we had to do it all so fast ive never cheated on betty not once we were married i mean
was this during betty
nobody did
i never knew that
not officially her and steve kendall were pinned at birth but i was crazy about her and for about three months i managed to catch her during her exploring stage
you never dated kathy reynolds
i used to love this place i used to take kathy reynolds down here
i think i better between the book and the coffee im this close to raping the busboy
not yet you want to go
boy all these years ive resented not living the wild life in some place like paris and all the time i couldve moved back to iowa are you drunk
i bet mom couldve helped her
you mean she didnt like sex
he remarried apparently they were having an affair for years apparently the first mrs delaney was a bit of a stiff
yeah but i thought she died
i found out who lucy delaney is remember the delaneys from hillcrest road
have you called betty maybe you should
bar across the street
and do what live alone go back to school find someone else start a magazine for confused woman what if i cant do any of those things
then why do you
oh dont feel sorry for me please no ones forcing me to stay
i had no idea its gotten that bad sis
i dont think so not yet anyway and besides something like that doesnt make you a bad person he reminds me of steve in a way steves weak immoral and a liar but hes still a real nice guy he just shouldnt be married at least not to me you getting hungry im hungry
nice hes trying to sleep with somebodys wife
oh he did not hes such a nice guy
hes getting her drunk thats what happened jesus maybe he forced himself thats why she couldnt tell us
stop it i want to read them if you dont want to then just leave but dont you push me around like im some mule you paid for i already got a husband
no were going to lock this up and
well id like to read them
this is crazy she waits till shes dead to tell us all this well i got news for you she was my mother thats enough for me i dont have to know who she was
what are you doing
thats it
its all there in the three notebooks read them in order if you dont want to i suppose thats okay too but in that case i want you to know something i never stopped loving your father he was a very good man its just that my love for robert was different he brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before or since he made me feel like a woman in a way few women maybe more ever experience
grateful
sshhh after going through the safety deposit box im sure youll find youre way to this letter its hard to write this to my own children i could let this die with the rest of me i suppose but as one gets older one fears subside what becomes more and more important is to be known known for all that you were during this brief stay row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were its easy for a mother to love her children no matter what its something that just happens i dont know if its as simple for children youre all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong but i thought it was important to give you that chance to give you the opportunity to love me for all that i was
i cant believe shes making jokes
no i dont think so i
how did she meet him did dad know anything else in that envelope
i cant believe she never told me we spoke at least once a week how could she do that
well what am i supposed to think
dont say that
dont talk to me like that she was my mother for christsakes and now i find out she was she was a
my lord it must feel real nice living inside your head with peter pan and the easter bunny
this happened way before we both got married i i cant believe it you think she had sex with him
i dont know im completely in the dark here thats what i get for moving away
wait a minute that was thirty years after daddy do you think
""
damn him i knew mama wouldnt have thought of that herself it was some damn perverted photographic mind influencing her when did the bastard die
that he be cremated and his ashes thrown on roseman bridge
what
that would be some trick hes already dead thats what this other letter is from his attorney he left most of his things to mama and requested
robert jesus ill kill him
well he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him she could find him through the national geographic magazine he as a photographer he promises not to write again then all it says is i love you robert
whats he saying now
goddamn sonofabitch i dont want to hear anymore sonofabitch burn the damn thing i dont want to hear it throw it away
going over and over in my mind every detail every moment of our time together and i ask myself what happened to me in madison county i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing were on separate roads but then i look through the lens of my camera and youre there i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you its clear to me now we have been moving towards each other towards those four days all our lives
come here a minute
what
michael
yeah
well i dont care if its legal or not were not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we cant even go visit her because shes going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray
i remember a mrs delaney but mama told me years ago she died
what problem
well theres a problem
i thought everything was arranged
hes not coming
he dropped them off at bettys mom wheres steve
i have some sandwich fixings if youre hungry
lawyer here
moms orders
explain to me again why we didnt do this in des moines in an air conditioned office
robert if that happens youll have to decide i wont be able to
i cant say goodbye yet well leave it for now were not saying goodbye were not making any decision maybe youll change your mind maybe well accidentally run into each other and and youll change your mind
no dont do this
im going to be here a few more days ill be at the inn we have some time lets not say any more now
i dont know please
i want to keep it forever i want to love you the way i do now the rest of my life dont you understand well lose it if we leave i cant make an entire life disappear to start a new one all i can do is try to hold onto to both help me help me not lose loving you
but now that you have it
robert please you dont understand no one does when a woman makes the choice to marry to have children in one way her life begins but in another way it stops you build a life of details you become a mother a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move and when they leave they take your life of details with them and then youre expected move again only you dont remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long not even yourself you never in your life think that love like this can happen to you
to hell with you
we are the choices weve made robert
francesca listen to me you think whats happened to us happens to just anybody what we feel for each other how much we feel were not even two separate people anymore some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone most people dont even think it exists and youre going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do that staying here alone in a marriage alone in a town you hate in a house you dont feel apart of anymore youre telling me thats the right thing to do
no matter how much distance we put between us and this house i bring with it with me and ill feel it every minute were together and ill blame loving you for how much it hurts and then even these four days wont be anything more than something sordid and a mistake
yeah it could get better
youve got to know deep down that the minute we leave here itll all change
what about us what about me
no they dont say much but carolyns shes just about to find out about all this for herself shes going to fall in love shes going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone if i leave what does that say to her
the kids are grown they dont need you anymore you told me that they hardly talk to you
his familys lived for almost a hundred years richard doesnt know how to live anywhere else and the kids
then he can move people move
for anyone theyll never be able to live through the talk richard will never be able to he doesnt deserve that he hasnt hurt anyone in his life
for who
no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind it doesnt seem like the right thing
what makes it different robert
if ive done anything to make you think that whats happened between us is nothing new for me is some routine then i do apologize
what does that have to do with it
because i cant have you
why
i dont want to need you
you wont be made to feel period youve carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time youve touched our lives well go to hell it isnt human not to feel lonely it isnt human not to afraid youre a hypocrite and youre a phony
i wont be made to feel like ive done something wrong
no ones asking you to
i told you i wont apologize for who i am
fine more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time
stop it
i dont want you to say anything i dont need you to say anything
what do you want me to say
you have no idea what youve done to me do you and after you leave im going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here if anything happened at all and ill have to wonder if you find yourself in some housewifes kitchen in romania if youll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group
stop it
i know you what can this possibly mean to anyone who doesnt need meaning who goes with the mystery who pretends he isnt scared to death
how do you know what i experience
gee i dont know i guess im not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time
what are you doing
yes absolutely you have this habit of not needing and that its hard to break i understand of course in that case why sleep you dont need rest or for that matter eat you dont need food
i was honest with you i told you who i was
to do what be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular i mean what would be the point would you pass the butter
well why is that up to me youre the one whos married you told me you have no intention of leaving your husband
well what is this
routine i dont have a routine and if you think thats what this is
well i just want to know the procedure i dont want to upset your routine do you want any jam
i what do you want
well these women friends of yours all over the world how does it work do you see some of them again do you forget others do you write them now and then how do you manage it
what
good more coffee robert i hope you dont mind my asking but i feel like i should
yes thanks
sleep all right
no
am i too heavy for you
long day go to sleep
i dont know why im so tired all of a sudden
across the street she went into the park and got turned around and didnt know her way out
where was she
youre right you know we dont have much time
uhhuh and
just that its been a perfect day and that id like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this
youre somewhere else where
try and live a lifetime before friday cram it all in
what
i cant do this honey
what were your parents like
i had a temper
i just wondered why were you trouble
trouble why
what were you like when you were younger
no i dont mind
but you dont mind
because i already tried once
why do you say that
no i couldnt
i bet you could do a book
hes a genius theyre not photographs theyre stories entire histories captured in moments
on that one is beautiful look at their expressions as if the camera werent on them at all as if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling
i sat there once it was hot like today id been shopping i had all these bags around my feet i kept having to move every time the waiter came by
near the church
where near the doorway or the near the front of the church
i sat outside and had coffee
and arraccinos and zeppolis yes i know it
nobodys asking you to
why because im having thoughts i hardly know what to do with i cant seem to stop them
why
i just feel like im getting a little out of control thats all its kind of frightening
its okay its not that hot anymore thanks god
oh im sorry
you know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas
yes
have you ever been to that station
yes tell me about the day you got off the train
how about bari
yes
how about italy
right now tell me someplace youve been someplace on the other side of the world anywhere but here
what
take me somewhere
no
are you hungry
you want to eat something
no i cant not yet
are you comfortable do you want to move to the bedroom
yes thatd be nice
would you like a beer for your bath
sure
how about if i set the table
actually no ive got everything under control id like to clean up myself a bit im going to take a bath dinnerll be ready in about a half hour
can i help
couple want to help
fine theyre all having a good time how many more shots do you have
oh how is he
sorry im late richard called
i want you to come
yeah
i understand thats very kind of you
i now know more about their affair than i remember about my marriage francesca the last thing i want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would even though we know its just i mean its nothing like that but if anybody saw us or
i think hes running for town crier next year
the cashier at the general store was very dangerous
oh i guess you got the whole story
i uh i had lunch in town today happened to cross paths with that redfield woman i apologize i thought you were halfjoking about that
oh
listen dont take this the wrong way but im wondering if this is such a good idea
oh hi look im running a little late but ill still
its robert
yeah see you later
okay see you later
no ill drive myself i have a few errands ill meet you there
ill pick you up
oh sure great
listen i have to shoot cedar bridge until a little after sunset i want a few night shots would you like to come with me if youre interested
wonderful uh
i would love to come for dinner
the light was fading huhhuh
im sorry i didnt call sooner but i just read your note i stuffed it into my pocket the light was fading and i had to get my shot
no i was just no
am i interrupting anything
yes hi
francesca
i feel like somethings been spoiled now
no no forgive me i made a mistake it was an inappropriate thing to ask
listen im sorry i
i already apologized
i thought we were just having a conversation you seem to be reading all this meaning into it meanings i must be too simple to uh interpret or something
i thought thats what we were doing asking questions
what made you ask such a question
my mistake i apologize
do you want to leave your husband
just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesnt necessarily mean theyre hypnotized just because ive never seen a gazelle stampede doesnt mean im asleep in the world
im a little sick of this american family ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country i guess you think im just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a selfcleaning oven and home movie
no im just saying
thats not what youre saying i know its not the same what youre saying is its not as good or its not as normal or proper
but its not the same
no but i love them just the same
but no one in particular
i told you i love other people
but how can you just live for what you want what about other people
not everybodys supposed to have a family
do you ever regret not having a family
no
do you ever regret it the divorce i mean
i embrace mystery i dont know whats coming and i dont mind
why doesnt it scare you
no i think i need everyone i love people i want to meet them all i just think there are too many out there saying this is mine or shes mine too many lines have been drawn worlds breaking apart because of mans weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people he wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly
you really dont need anyone
im a loner im not a monk
woman friends too
never touch the stuff ive got friends all over the world good friends i can see when i want if i want
you must get lonely at times
i never got lost for some reason im more at home everywhere than at one place so i decided ill think of myself as some kind of world citizen i belong everywhere and nowhere im kin to everyone and no one in particular see once you get into the habit of not needing anyone its kind of hard to break
so what happened
not at all i wasnt around much so why did i get married well i thought it was a good idea at the time have a home base roots you can get lost moving around so much
do you mind if i ask you why you got divorced
were not doing anything wrong do you
what
francesca
yes
are you all right
what
francesca
no ill do them later
you sure you wont let me help you with those dishes
id appreciate it i like knowing who im stealing from if you cant create art i think the least you can do is recognize it around you dont you think there is so much beauty
umm i dont know i can look it up
this of what i call god and fools can nature who wrote that
what
youve got it all right here you know its just as beautiful as any other place ive seen god it knocks me out
no im all right its working
you want to go back in
when
you get used to it
smells like dirt
no you rub it on you i have some in the truck dont go away
you drink bug repellent
have no fear this shoshone medicine woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root
well its kind of buggy out there
they have safaris for tourists now maybe you can convince your husband
my god how id love to see that
this is your home its not nowhere and its not dull
no its all right i just meant it might be a little dull for you telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere
im sorry that was
youre asking a man if hes too tired to talk about himself you dont get out much do you
i dont know ive never thought about it what was the most exciting place youve ever been to unless youre tired of talking about it
do you miss it
my children and richard didnt like my working
why did you stop
id like to think so i know one of them went on to medical school
and did you
well lets just call it a compliment and move on did you love teaching
i didnt mean that the way it sounded
i dont think youre normal
no i wouldnt say that national geographic isnt exactly the hub of artistic inspiration they like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment i dont mind really im not artist id faced that a long time ago its the course of being welladjusted im too normal
you sound like an artist
i dont know if obsessions have reasons i think thats why theyre obsessions
why do you think
im kind of obsessed by it actually
making pictures i like that you really love what you do dont you
nah ive tried my writings too technical i think problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent i better just stick to making pictures
you ought to write these stories down
oh you
we got engaged
then what happened
its still a very sensitive memory for me
oh my god youre blushing
she starts sniffing me
what
okay
sure men cook we dont all eat bananas with our feet ya know
help cook
thats very nice of you i dont get many dinner invitations on the job it would be a welcome change thanks
would you like to stay for dinner there arent many choices in town and anyway youd have to eat alone so would i
you have no reason to feel ashamed you havent said anything you dont have a right to and if anybody tells you different you just send them to me
but i we dont even know each other
why you uncorked a bottle from what i can tell i got here just in time any later and youd have made the front page running down main street naked smoking camels out of your butt
i feel so embarrassed
i better go you sure youre all right its been a pleasure sincerely
i think so
is the dizziness gone
much
feeling better
yes very clean
and clean
no i mean yes hes clean but hes also other things hes a very hard worker very honest very caring gentle good father
clean
hes very clean
whats he like
richard was in the army i met him while i was living in naples i didnt know where iowa was i only cared that it was america and of course being with richard
italy to iowa id call that a change
why
i doubt that
i guess except im one of the people it frightens
everything does one of the laws of nature people are always so afraid of change but if you look at it like its something you can count on happening its actually a comfort not many things you can count on for sure
must be nice having kids
oh michaels and carolyns
no your kids
about a year and a half
oh how old
my husband took the kids to the illinos state fair my daughters entering a prize steer

this isnt friendship

thanks the f is one of the most difficult planes to master oh you call them tomcats and in the s the first crop had a number of crashes
i think the pilot that shot down the libyan in is stationed right here maybe you could get him and maybe tom should say that our f is one of the hardest planes to fly theyre nicknamed tomcats
ill come by your place right afterdrink take pills love you

i write for you sometimes

of course
did you shoot their boots
okay great line at the end
you spend too much time much too much worrying about that crap oh good
last time paul was sick they gave connie the weekend news instead of me
if we dont get to their camp soon we wont be able to tape the supplies coming in
i didnt sleep theyre giving me less and less air time they dont think im at all anchor material
oh god back it bobbie bobbie

you want to start going over who they could have gotten they cant take on people like this for network news for gods sake whats going on
they didnt hire peter stiller from the utimesu and he had a great audition tape
call if you get weird
wouldnt this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive if needy were a turnon
good night
id give anything if that were true
this conversation is not worthy of you
okay i feel like im slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think theyre slipping because their standards are so high
sure
okay lets do me
because nobody invites a bad looking idiot to their bedroom
why do you say that
he must have been greatlooking right
no it makes me nervous to think about it lets do this
wheres where i asked him about being scared you should work on your speech

the costefficient reporter

its been a while since you read the news ill have somebody work with you just on superficial performance things
prepare what you have saturdays news handy
please prepare carefully this couldnt come at a better time
do it then
i could do it this saturday everyone wants off for the correspondents dinner
do one thing to me get me one shot at anchoring the weekend news theyve never seen me do it i think it could turn them around
all i know is that theyve got to fire a large number of people and theyre not going by seniority theres a recklessness in the air they
ah damn the fucking jerks my god they want to fire me
im no suggesting the worst will happenbut someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe the next time that happens down the road you should look into it
wait bullshit me a littleim beginning to appreciate it
aaron ive never seen them like this i think pauls nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to
upper management thinks youre dull
just blunt talk okay id really appreciate bluntness
anyway i want you to think of this as
wipe me out
we know each other well enough for me to care how i put something to you which could wipe you out so i will phrase things the way i think they should be phrased all right
just tell me whats really going on i think we know each other well enough for me to expect that
i dont know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you
yeah
outside
oh i was just writing you a note what do you say we take a walk
ill tell you what ill stay if tom knows how to spell gaddafi

i had the strangest thing happen yesterday anne and i have been married what thirtysix years everything fine two days after the promotion came through i was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back so yesterday i looked in the mirror and she was doing it again
im gonna go look at it again
i saw the smile good piece

how long has it been since youve been home
move away from me
we came from washington
no
just a few questions
my gosh and for a while there i was attracted to you
no i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser
you think anyone whos proud of the work we do is an ass kisser
take care paul it takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the president of the news division
goodbye paul
oh come on tell us another
i was a little nervous there for a minute
we have a minute and a half its my responsibility to tell them we wont be ready

i just got back i dont know which end is up

i cant help you sorry im not here to teach remedial reporting
you make me nervous anyway if i can pick your brain
really a lot appreciate it
i thought you were incredible in there i know how much i have to learn id really a lot appreciate itif
no aaron and i go to central america on wednesday so im cramming
i cant believe im really here no kidding if youre through work now
you werent thanks how does it feel being here
im sorry if i was in the way it was totally impressive great piece
were working here you can stand over in the uh uh uh
they said it would be okay if
those audition tapes i sent out ive been hired by your network for the washington bureau so ill probably see you at work sorry
hey
i never told you the reason i was telling you everything for
just what do you want from me anyway permission to be a fake stop whining and do something about it
whoa this was a mistake
i agree with you youre not qualified so get qualified you can insist on being better prepared you dont have to just leave it as i dont write im not schooled i dont understand the news im reading but at least im upset about it folks
uhhuh
its hard for me to advise you since you personify something that i truly think is dangerous
so youre not well educated and you have almost no experience and you cant write
one yearalmost one year
well come on it is your life nobody is tying you to the fast track did you go to college
but that didnt stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks
i dont write
what about the obvious remedy reversing things maybe getting a job on a newspaper
i didnt even have the chance to get really good at sports i wasnt bad i thought i was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and
i trust you
listen to me you keep on thinking im somebody ho lacksconfidence thats not it i know i can talk well enough and im not bad at making contact with people but i dont like the feeling that im pretending to be a reporter and half the time i dont really get the news im talking about it isnt that im down on myself trust me i stink
how are you at back rubs
except im no good at what im being a success at
so great right
i was doing sports at the station the newspaper ran this untrue story that i was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail so they made me anchor
no i really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up
come oneven im not that hard on myself
yes sure
yes my room is down here im not tired do you want to keep talking
that actually goes on
another thing i cant stand is when white house reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as white house sources say
nooo if i could just have a roll id be okay
totally understood totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day youve had totally sorry
if we could just eat first
i havent been in news that long ive just been looking for the right person to talk to i have about two thousand questions for you
i like godsend
i kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight more than a great break maybe just what i neededjust when i needed itangel of mercy godsendlifesaverwhat
i was a lot earlier
hi i was worried i was early
well they say if you can reach even one person it means something and you did that
thank you they hated me i dont hate them
i just wanted to tell you how great you were my names tom grunick

what a nasty thing to say
wellhe calls it the bermuda triangle he said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again
yes i do
crash once called a womans uh pussyyknow how the hair kinda makes a v shape

you know what it feels like to throw a three hitter we better not fuck
now dont go overboard i look incredibly hot right
not that i mean the rechanneling of my sexual energy maybe we shouldnt make love for awhile
breathing through your pingala always works honey
yknow annie i been thinking if it works for one game maybe itll work for a whole buncha games
im yours
yes and so is birth now look me in the eyes nuke you havent been wearing my panties have you
death is like spring training

godi think im gonna be sick
its all the same thing
i cant keep up with you first you say sex is gonna make me a better pitchernow no sex is gonna do it
much better your delivery was fully integrated because you werent thinking about it cause you were pissed off at me this is progress
how ya like that
gimme the god damn ball
a little better
how was that
hes handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six
if i throw too hard ill hurt the kid
youre patronizing me i will not be patronized
right okay fire a couple in there
switch nostrils
the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball and if you discover before a game youre in the wrong nostril its easy to switch
im really beat i need some serious zs
the ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril
there are two important psychic conduits called the pingala and the ida the pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril
my right nostril
the right nostril good
which nostril am i breathing through
just do what i say now which nostril are you breathing through
this in ridiculous im a pro
catch
good total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous lets play catch
sorry you look great im totally exhausted
what is this i i i stuff you only talk about yourself arent you glad to see me dont i look nice
god im tired what a trip i was lousy i was worse than lousy everytime i pitchedit was like throwing gasoline on a fire kaboom i
they did when they were in the carolina league
big league pitchers dont use these
youve been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain thesell help move things to the right side
jesus annie i dont know
theyll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that youll start seeing things differentlyplus theyll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters
what
i want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch
there is a lot of things you never thought of sweetienow get some rest for tonights game
god i never thought of that
yknow if you make it to the bigs you could still become the host of dance fever baseballs a good stepping stone for things like that
i wanted to be the host of dance fever somethin like that
you can learn to like it
mmm hmmm you shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off when i got drafted first it was the happiest day of my fathers life he likes baseball more than i do
you see how nice things are when we go slow
yeah maybe youre right
would you rather me be making love to him using your name or making love to you using his name
you said crash
honey dont ever listen to a woman when shes making love theyll say the strangest things
you said crash
i didnt say crash i said nuke
you mean nuke you said crash
i can do that too
i got a lotta time to hear your theories and i wanta hear every damn one of embut right now im tired and i dont wanta think about baseball and i dont wanta think about quantum physics i dont wanta think about nothing i just wanta be
what
annie
youd be great just great cause you understand nonlinear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game cause of the lines and the box scores an allbut the fact is that theres a spaciousnontime kind of time to it
you think i could make it to the show as a manager
not yet it takes years of practice
yeahyou a witch
salem massachusetts where all the witches were
there might be an opening for a manager at salem next spring
im quitting too boys not baseball
i quit hit my dinger and hung em up
what happened
it doesnt work like that god youre gorgeous want to dance
how come in former lifetimes everybody was someone famous how come nobody ever says they were joe schmo
so you see in a former lifetime im sure that i was alexandria the czarette of russia what do you think
i heard already
i got released
whatta you mean why not are you gonna play forever
why not
welli used to think that wasnt the worst thing in the world to look forward to lately im not so sure
are you gonna be waking up next to year old ballplayers when youre
no
its possible
its true its true least it used to be true it aint possible that baseballs not enough anymore is it crash
i dont know if id go that far
if you know where home plate is then you know where st base is and nd and everything else cause theyre always in the same place in relation to home dont you see if you know where home plate is then you know where everything else in the universe is
whats so great about baseball
thurman munson he was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybodyit was beautiful and he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition so i stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand whats so great about baseball
who
i crossed the streetit was the new york yankees spring training fieldtok tok tok was the sound of a ball hitting a bat and i sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother and i saw him
i was raised in a baptist church got dipped in the water when i was born again before kindergartenby the time i was i knew it was bullshit and at i ran away from home
why baseball
you okay
god damn youwhat is happening is there no man wholl have me this is the weirdest season i ever sawthe durham bulls cant lose and i cant get laid
annie i think you should leave
i said when i think about you i get wet
and as soon as we lose a game hell be back in your arms
im ready for a complicated man
i thought you wanted an uncomplicated boy
crash i get wet just thinking about you
i doubt that
i dont imagine theres much i could teach you
and now you wanta teach me
i teach part time at the junior college what if i told you i was through with nuke he learned his lessons quickly and left me
who are you do you have a job
i want you desperately
and hes right a ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak they dont happen very often you know how hard this game is if you believe youre playing well because youre getting laid or because youre not getting laid or because you wore red silk pantiesthen you are and i still think thomas pynchon is full of shit
he wont make love to me anymore
i think of you and the boy all the time
i want to be had
youre gorgeous god damn it from the moment i first saw you i knew i had to have you i had to have you
dont you think im pretty
arent we all
he s confused
nuke wont go to bed with you eh
crashi want you
im not a real batter im a woman
a batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing
you got me all confused
well annie your place or mine
fact is youre afraid of meeting a guy like me cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around great deal you get to write self indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing so what do you really want you wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic or do you want a guy
despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most judaochristian ethics i am within the framework of a baseball season monogamous
your place or mine
let me
damn
no please
oh no i think itd be great the sporting news should know about it
home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor if ya think about it
why not if you hit twenty homers this year youll be the all time minor league champ the records
dont tell anybody
but theyre nice hips i looked up your records youve hit home runs in the minors thats great
youre pulling your hips out
damn
thats my job too
young men are uncomplicated and hes not dim hes just inexperienced my job is to give him lifewisdom and help him make it to the major leagues
whatyou see in that guyhes dim pretty boy a young wild
im committed to nuke for the season you had your chance the other night
sowanta make love
but you were pulling your hips last night
when youre hitting you shouldnt think about anything but hitting but you shouldnt think about it too much the trick is to use your brain to not use your brain
i think thomas pynchons a genius
yep
see my hips
im not interested yet
im not interested in a woman whos interested in that boy
wait crashdont goall i want is a date im not gonna fall in love with you or nothin
gnight
oh my dont leave
i believe in the soul the cock the pussy the small of a womans back the hanging curve ball high fiber good scotch long foreplay show tunes and that the novels of thomas pynchon are selfindulgent overrated crap i believe that lee harvey oswald acted alone i believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astroturf and the designated hitter i believe in the sweet spot voting every election soft core pornography chocolate chip cookies opening your presents on christmas morning rather than christmas eve and i believe in long slow deep soft wet kisses that last for days
what do you believe in
after years in the minor leagues i dont tryout besides i dont believe in quantum physics when it comes to matters of the heartor loins
actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other its all quantum physics and molecular attraction there are laws we dont understand that bring us together and break us apart
why do you get to choose why dont i get to choose
these are the ground rules i hook up with one guy a season i mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guykinda my own spring training and well you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far so i thought we should get to know each other
ill learn cmon

no i do it was the stamps on that letter charles had with him on the train they were in plain sight all the time but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope
calm down mrs lampert please does he have the money
the one who said he was dyles brother of course im sure tex wrote the word dyle before he died hes the murderer i tell you hes the only one left youve got to do something
just a minute mrs lampert youd better give that to me slowly whos adam
none whatsoever please mrs lampert be careful
are you sure theres no mistake
i told them what you said about this man being carson dyles brother i asked them what they knew about it and they told me youre not gonna like this mrs lampert they told me carson dyle has no brother
go ahead mr bartholomew im listening
mrs lampert bartholomew ive spoken to washington mrs lampert
yes
agents
youre in an ideal position he trusts you besides you said yourself women make the best spies
me why me
i dont know but i think youd better find out dont you
oh then whos this one
no mrs lampert his death is registered with the war department in washington
but no one actually saw him die
no mrs lampert
maybe he really is dyle he could still be alive
were anxious to know who this man is the one calling himself dyle
oh stop it what do you want me to do
thats the spirit
well if im going to die i might as well do it for my country
i wouldnt advise that mrs lampert youd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave those men wont be very far away no matter where you go in fact i dont even see any point in your changing hotels please help us mrs lampert your government is counting on you
im sorry mr bartholomew but nothing youve told me has changed my mind i still intend leaving paris tonight
cia mrs lampert were an extension of the wartime oss it was our money and we want it back
but what has all this got to do with the cio
we know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together but we still have no proof
but if they stole all that money why cant you arrest them
carson was dying so they were forced to leave him they finally got back to the base made their report and waited for the war to end only charles couldnt wait quite as long as the others he beat them back to the gold took everything for himself and disappeared its taken gideon tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again
scobie was able to travel but carson dyle was clearly dying so they
please go on mr bartholomew what happened then
have you any idea what these things cost over here
may i have a cigarette please
by burying it and then reporting that the germans had captured it all they had to do was come back after the war dig it up and split it five ways a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked
steal it how
yes the five men they were of course your husband charles the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday and carson dyle but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money
go on please five men the french underground
can i at least keep the onion soup
mrs lampert i really hadnt planned on spending the entire night here
gratine choucroute garnie salade de pommes et un ballon de rouge
caf
in five members of the oss the military espionage unit were ordered behind the german lines for the purpose of delivering in gold to the french underground the five men
barely yes
i suppose youre old enough to have heard of world war two
dead mr bartholomew maybe youd better tell me what this things all about
i didnt see any point dyles dead
mr bartholomew why didnt you tell me you knew about dyle
you mean youve known about him all along why didnt you tell me
theres only one dyle connected with this affair mrs lampert thats carson
carson
thats not carson dyle
no what
no
well hes tall over six feet rather thin in good physical shape id say dark eyes quite handsome really
describe him
hes hardly my mr dyle
what does your mr dyle look like mrs lampert
dyle or whatever his name is
who
he has a gun mr bartholomew i saw it

were you followed
what did you want to see me about mr bartholomew
yes where in fifteen minutes ill be there
where are you now can you meet me do you know les halles
you mean he might have mr bartholomew im catching the next plane out of here im not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me
i dont know who this mr dyle is but its just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband
like i said mrs lampert im afraid youre in a great deal of danger remember what happened to charles
oh
because theyre still here
why not
well there you are charles had the money with him so whoever killed him has it they have it
weve no proof of course but we rather think so yes
wait a minute you think those three men killed charles dont you
heres where youre to call me day or night its a direct line to both my office and my apartment dont lose it mrs lampert and please dont tell anyone about coming to see me it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself
look for it mrs lampert look just as hard and as fast as you can you may not have a great deal of time those men know you have it just as surely as we do you wont be safe until the moneys in our hands is that clear
but
or a safe deposit key a certified check a baggage claim you look for it mrs lampert im quite sure youll find it
you mean its just lying around someplace all that cash
nevertheless mrs lampert youve got it
mr bartholomew if i had a quarter of a million dollars believe me id know it
oh youve got the money all right you just dont know youve got it
thanks very much
i believe you
im sorry its impossible its the truth
thats impossible youre the only one who could have it
but i dont have it
and im afraid we want it back
oh i see
ours
then whose is it his or theirs
oh mrs lampert id love to see you try and convince them of that oh dear
but its charless money not theirs
oh havent i the money mrs lampert the money the charles voss received from the auction those three men want it too they want it very badly
gladly only i dont know what you want you havent told me

its hers whered you find him robbing a bank

howdy miz lampert
then he gets it out of your share not mine not mine
shoot no not after all these years
he took care of charlie for us
yeah whats that
dont be unneighborlylike herman dont forget he done us a little ol favor
we took all the chances the money belongs to us not him
whatever you do love it like you loved that projection booth of the paradiso when you were little
thanks for all youve done for me
no toto nobody said it i say it lifes not like you saw it in the movies lifeis harder get out go back to rome you re young the world is yours and im oldi dont want to hear you talk any more i want to hear talk about you
who said that gary cooper james stewart henry fonda huh
do like the soldier toto go away this land is cursed when youre here every day you feel like youre at the center of the universe it seems like nothing ever changes then you go away one year twoand when you come back everythings different the thread has broken you dont find those you were looking for your things no longer exist isnt that the caseyouve got to go away a long time for many many years before coming back and finding your people again the land where you were bornbut not now its impossible now youre blinder than i am
now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his but she also could not have kept her promise andthat would have been terrible he would have died from it so instead for ninetynine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him
listen to this onethe commander says to the sergeant you remember that windmill that used to be there yes sir i remember the mills gone but the winds still there you remember the story of the soldier and the princess
it was probably meant to be like this each of us has a star to follow so now what are you thinking of doing
no and nobody knows where she is
did you ever see her again
toto sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing so its better to shut up its hot in here toto take me to the beach
they tell me you never go out never talk to anybody why
you re thinneryou can tell youve not been treated well
no nobody came
im here take it easy take it easy sit down sit down did she come
but whered you go toto
you were expecting her huh its a nasty business waiting by yourself in company its better nothen ill leave
no alfredo i was coming to help you
you werent expecting me
could bebut i dont like this business it smells fishy to me
just so alfredo there isnt any and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss
toto are you pulling my leg or something how is it possible to see this television without film
no you mean right at the end alfredo thats right toto right at the end and dont ask me what it means if you figure it out let me know
i want to make you happy toto im going to tell you a story once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all and he immediately fell in love with her but what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughterone day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end ill be yours christ the soldier ran off there and waited one day two days ten twentyevery night she looked out of her window but he never budged come rain wind snow never budged the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back he didnt even have the strength to sleep any more the princess kept watchand on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left
you see it s like i say you always have an answer for everything
heeey totooooo dont get pissed off with me now come here i dont know where the fuck i have to go and the next time be careful how you talk not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better but unfortunately such was not the case
stop it ive had enough of your sermons you act as if you created the world
dont think about it toto dont even try with feelings theres nothing to understand
but why there must be some way to make her understand
i told you the blueeyed ones are the most difficult
theyre not my words john wayne said it in shepherd of the hills
what you say is wonderful but sad
eh lovewhat a mystery i understand you totothe ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful whatever you do you cant make friends with them eh theres nothing to be done about it the heavier a man is the deeper his footprints and if hes in love he suffers because he knows hes up a oneway street because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants
whats she like whats she like
yes its a girl i saw at the station
is there a womantell me the truth there is a woman
nothing theres nothing its all out of focus
now what can you see
its people in the slaughterhouse killing a calf theres blood all over the floor like a lake and through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die
what is it what is it whats the picture
yes
ive shown it so many times i know it by heart the first time i showed it in was the sunday my first wife died they kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldnt have to close down the movie house i only found out that night after the last show those are things you never forget so toto how are these home movies going
thats right modern times
chaplins modern times right toto
progress it always arrives too late
whatd i tell you it doesnt catch fire
for example at this moment the films out of focus go see
yes i want proof
toto this isnt for you for the moment the cinema paradiso needs you and you need the cinema paradiso but it wont lastsome day youll have other things to do more important things thats right more important i know it now that ive lost my sight i see more i see everything i didnt see before and its all thanks to you who saved my life and ill never forget it and dont put on that look i havent gone off my head yet you want proof
why what do you mean
dont do thatsooner or later youll be left emptyhanded
ok ok but now that ive got a job i probably stop going
hows school
come in alfredo
any room for me in this cinema paradiso
too bad
its got to be sent to another town and if we dont the owner of that movie house gets pissed off
peppinoooo come back sooon good thing germanys closer than russia
who knowsits like an adventure hope springs eternal
will they really find work in germany
it tastes wonderful
you understand which side the gelatins on
alfredo go fuck yourself
with timeyou get used to it besides when you hear from up here that theres a full house and that people are laughing having fun then youre happy too so ive been wasting my breath you pretend to agree with me but as soon as my back is turned you do what you want get out of here i dont want to lay eyes on you again this is the last straw your mothers right youre crazy but howd he do it the little bastard by watching hes learned its incredible im letting the box office know youre not to set foot even into the theatre there are no more tickets for you and im also talking to father adelfio you wont be an altar boy any more either you little runt
but dont you like anything about what you do
good for you toto good for you im only saying this for your own good cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter you breathe in smoke gas fumes and earn practically nothing
no
because im an idiot how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist none only a jerk like me could do it besides i wasnt lucky when i was a kid there was the war when i grew up another war now its all different times have changed and you want to be a dope like me huh answer me
then why dont you change jobs
because i dont want to toto this is not a job for you its like being a slave youre always alone you see the same film over and over again because you have nothing else to do and you start talking to greta garbo and tyrone power like a nut you work on holidays on christmas on easter only on good friday are you free but if they hadnt put jesus christ on a crossyoud work good fridays too
then why dont you want to teach it to me too now that theres no more cranking and its easier
now listen to what ive got to say i took up this profession when i was ten years old in those days there werent these modern machines the films were silent the projectors were run by hand like this with a crank and you wound the crank all day long it was really rough going if you got tired and slowed down boom everything would go up in flames
toto come here
i told my mother you werent the one who gave me the films that it wasnt your fault but i thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me now that i know i wont steal any more from you thats all i wanted to say im going
all right all right when ive got kids thats what im telling them
but you dont have any kids
i choose my friends for their looks and my enemies for their brains youre too smart to be my friend besides as i always tell my kids be careful to pick the right friends
of course i knew your father he was tall thin pleasant and had a moustache like mine always smiling he looked like clark gable
alfredo did you know my father
what you find tonight on the floor between the seats
fifty lire
signora maria dont do that hes just a kid and why are you telling fibs we let him in free he must have lost the money inside the movie theatre how much did you have
i bought a ticket ive come to see the film
what are you doing here
look toto before i kick your ass all the way to china and back lets make a deal these strips here are yours i give them to you however one youre not to stick your nose in here any more two ill keep them for you because you cant take them home for god forbid and save our souls if they catch fire all hell will break loose ok oh and now scram
so i can have these
cause sometimes you cant find the right place any more and sowell actuallythey stay here besides there are more kisses than you can count
and turn into a piece of charcoal
you must not come here how many times do i have to tell you if the film catches fire runt that you are youd go up in a burst of flamewhoosh and turn into a piece of
and the next time dont go around saying such heresy you survived the fire at the movie house but no one can save you from the fire of hell
oh yes father now everythings clear
you understand now you see it clearly
i know but take themiracle of the loaves and fishes for example i think about it a lothow is it possible for
but alfredo what youre saying is horrifying
father adelfio i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul and youve got to help me because ive lost all peace of mind
what is it alfredo right now of all times
yeahgetting theres downhill and all the saints help you but coming back the saints stand there watching you thats all gods will be done
good morning father its hard on the feet huh
ill never agree with you never elena
no salvatorethere is no future theres only the past even meeting last night was nothing but a dream a beautiful dream we never did it when we were kids remember now that its happened i dont think there could have been a better ending
what difference does it make to find an explanation thats the way it went but alfredo didnt betray you he was the only one who really understood you salvatore if you had chosen to be with me youd have never made your films and that would have been a pity because theyre wonderful ive seen them all but you shouldnt have gone and changed your name you should have kept your own
but i never saw that note i must have covered it with my hand without realizing it thats the only explanation
he wasnt crazy in the beginning i was upset i think i really hated him but then with time i understood what he saidand your silence too
oh how i looked for you elena youll never know i wrote telephoned nothing nobody ever answered but i dreamt of you for years thats why i went awayand never came back here even as the years passed in all the women i met i was only looking for you i had success its true but there was always something missing id never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me a crazy lunatic
i told him id take his advice but before i went away i left you that note i was on my way down the stairs
alfredo damn him he cast his spell on you too
its the first time ive had to chance to tell the story i never mentioned it to anybody
nor have i even though you disappeared but whats the point of talking about it we risk being pathetic and ridiculous you still live in rome
but ive never forgotten you elena
politics hes the district representative we met at the university in pisa

my husbandyou know him
all things considered yes even if it wasnt what i dreamt of then
no and im not married are you happy

and i never asked for one you have nothing to explain i always thought that what you did was right and that was that with no beating around the bush only one thing made me suffer bolting the door shut before going to bed at night
noits nothing to do with you its just that i was scared of coming back now after all these years i thought i was strong that i had forgotten lots of things instead i find its quite the opposite as if i had never left and yet i look at lia and feel as if i didnt know her and you mammai abandoned you ran away like a thief thought only of myself and never gave you an explanation
you shouldnt tell me that now after all these years i put all your things in here go in go in
no mamma it only takes an hour by air you know

nows not really the time to get into this
yesterday you were wondering about the wall how it was possible
holes i dont know what youre talking about
youre wrong since i met you i dont dream about holes anymore

jerry i
oh christ here it comes look i know you think im crazy i dont think i am but
i like you jerry a lot
i know that im just im nervous i reached out and grabbed the first thing out there i know theyre song lyrics and i know how i feel

latest casualty ernest harriman you heard of him
and you think group one is at war with group two
so now they feed us terrorists uto create fearu how much do you think an airport security system goes for then multiply it by every airport in the country
cold wars over jerry
there are all kinds of groups all kinds of initials but theyre all part of two warring factions one families that have held wealth for centuries they want one thing stability group two the boat rockers eisenhowers military industrial complex they want instability its a trillion dollar a year business when there isnt a hot war they make a cold one
elaborate on they okay

absolutely not a good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy if you can figure it out they screwed it up
can you prove any of this
stone is their spokesman you think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that theyd let him do it stones a disinformation flunky the face that hes alive says it all

johnny dancer youve been in my office ten times how come you never asked me about that picture before
what was your horses name
you dont have to burst in here every time jerry just call and make an appointment
i better get going

you know to be normal and live in the real world to swallow coca cola and eat kentucky fried chicken you have to be in a conspiracy uagainst yourselfu i cant lie to me liza and the more i strip through the sham the crazier i look to people like you cant you see thats what theyre counting on you want to go out sometime
i think youre different
you think im crazy
i cant promise you anything
you going to warn him
not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of
unasau is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake
hes cutting funding for nasa the milk cow of the aerospace industry were talking billions motive enough
motive
the presidents in europe tomorrow hell be in turkey right along this fault line they launched the space shuttle yesterday
well i jerry the point get there what does it have to do with the president
so why do you keep the picture up you wish you hadnt quit
not for years
do you still ride
i still dont see what it has to do with the president
not testing uusingu nukes are passe this is the weapon of the future
testing some top secret seismic weapon
come on six major earthquakes in the last three years the space shuttle in orbit for every one of them
i dont see the connection
then i cant be hurt anymore
liza sutton is dead
youve never seen her run
you shouldnt watch jerry its a moment without hope
ulizau
weve arranged for you to take the blame everyone knows how youve been harassing the poor girl
lysergic acid diethylamide with a little kicker of my own surely it must be coming back to you by now
whats that
could you be a little more specific
who have you been talking to jerry who else knows what you know
thats great good for you
im a very patient man
yes you do jerry quite well
do i know you
whatever
alright you can see her but she cant see you
then screw you ill rot
i dont know
thats not what i mean i want to see her
we got someone watching her hours a day she
ill do it on one condition i want to make sure shes okay
thats your option ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time in case you didnt know it youre crazy
im leaning toward no
you made your decision yet
well i dont know if
im not a violent man mr lowry not by nature anyhow but if you hurt liza in any way ill kill you does that seem honorable
it seemed like a possibility what about your intentions are they honorable
youre here because you figured i might show up
thats ironic because were here to protect her from you
you should think of me as liza suttons guardian angel
im not sure what you mean
i like that a gun to your head and you ask about your partner hes okay may have a headache for a few days are you here with honorable intentions
youre welcome wheres my partner
thank you
i want this box rigged with a beacon
its okay im game
i dont understand
in jerrys safety deposit box
you sound so sure
walters had nothing to do with your fathers murder
not a man ezekiel walters
i know the story a federal judge he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial
it was my fathers kept it in his wallet he was murdered
you do recognize it then
whered you get it
so youll believe what i tell you next because i need to find jerry and i dont think i can do that without you
if this was a spy novel your next words would be something like i now know too much to live why are you telling me all this
belief is immaterial whats important is the truth its been my job to find jerry im very much responsible for him
i dont believe you
jerry is dangerous jerry has killed
im still listening
yes thats right
these things youre talking about you did them to jerry
umy dogu one i intend to put to sleep extrapolate from there
a dog
and what did i say
jerry told me he bit your nose
it was it was
missionary penance you talk about it like it was a religion
me i was a minor missionary a heretic really but where else could a redblooded american boy lie cheat steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the allhighs besides now im trying to pay my penance
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it id arrest you right here
as in resulting in death we pushed the envelope until it wasnt even an envelope anymore
terminal
we experimented with hallucinogens we used electro shock to produce a vegetative state we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation
i am impressed we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card
as in ucatcher in the ryeu
mk ultra was terminated in but not the research it was renamed ex catcher
ask what you can do for your country that kind of thing
a vulgar pop term but yes take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin that was our goal
it was mind control umanchurianu ucandidateu kind of stuff right
years ago i worked for the cia in the mk ultra program are you familiar with it
truthll set you free im listening
what im about to tell you is partially documented the freedom of information act saw to that but much more of it isnt for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear im going to share secrets with you repeat any of it and youll simply bestow the title of paranoid upon yourself
please sit
fine what the hell is going on
if youre as impressed to see me as i am to see you youre very impressed indeed hows jerry feeling this morning
reeducating trained killers in the ways of polite society making sure the men whove gone over the edge wont hurt anyone that sort of thing
brain washing mind control that sort of thing
were very specialized
i didnt know the cia had psychiatrists
only on the football field
thats it i went to yale i hope you wont hold that against me
the truth shall make you free
veritas truth what is it they say about truth
a year ago i was leaving work late one night two guys tried to mug me it was horrible jerry came out of nowhere to my rescue then he started coming to see me couldve been a storybook if he wasnt crazy at first i did my beat to avoid him but theres something inside jerry and jerry made me see it uhe made meu usee himu that make sense
jerrys visits to your office why do you tolerate them why him
excuse me
a charming term now uwhy himu
honestly i think he has a crush on me
uwhy youu
im sorry what was the question again
heres a fresh one why you your colleague mr wilson says jerry wont speak to anyone else that seems oddly possessive behavior to me
youve asked me that one three times
and you have no idea where he lives
you already asked me that why do you insist on making me repeat myself
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president
it was my dog let me ask you a question how long have you been acquainted with jerry
and you feel bad for it
you were going to ask about my nose the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today
excuse me
a dog bit it
can i ask you something
i dont think so
that you come with me
what do you suggest
dont go home and dont go to work either one could be bad
im going to find him because hed find me
no idea honest what are you going to do
where do you think jerry is
jonas builds assassins for a living several of whom may be in place already wed like to kill a few birds with one stone
hes shown himself why havent you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do
hes why i watch jerry jerrys the bait for jonas
and jonas
im it really doesnt matter think cia and exponentiate im a government employee and ive been watching jerry for awhile
nothing i was just making sure so who are you
what gave me away
you think we have time to fool around like this come on
whos the deputy director of the fbi
what do you mean
i want to believe you too
yeah i do
do you believe me
go ahead well be right down

jonas

wait
while we walk dc police want him for assault secret service for counterfeiting and were tracking him on a string of bank robberies no one knows what the cia wants him for
tell me about it

really i thought he said it all the time
he told you hes failing in love with you ive never known him to say those words before
what your virginity well thats over now
but you knew this was important to me
you dont even know me the fact of the matter is there is some one i love shes smarter prettier you dont even compare to her the only reason i am here is because she wants us to be exclusive

refreshing
hows the water

the last thing i need is you going into my room searching for this while im away
give me the fucking letter
i sincerely doubt it
you know you could at least have the decency of telling me whos badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face how do you know its not some girl whos pissed off at me for breaking up with her
this is my favorite part even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it
what another letter from your friend
you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible
thank you
give me a minute ill be right down
please
gee with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse
oh come on quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool
at this hour i dont think so
why dont you come join me for a swim and well discuss it
you need help
thats a matter of opinion
romantic he rapes her
several times im not as dumb as i act you know when howard roark makes love to dominique francon most romantic scene in all of literature
youve read the fountainhead
great book
the fountainhead
whatcha reading
look i know this is your house and all but do you think you couid keep it down im trying to read
you talking to me
excuse me excuse me
alright i said i was sorry can we start over again i think weve gotten off on the wrong foot
look ive got a lot of problems and im trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me
why are you being so dramatic
fine forget it its obvious that were not going to be friends
its not really important
who the hell is taking the time to write letters spreading this shit about me
im sorry i didnt mean to upset you but you still didnt answer the question
well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip
a friend wrote me
how do you know ive been with several women
take yourself youve slept with several women are you happier because of it
oh really
i wasnt knocking anything its just my belief that people shouldnt actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions
most people are morons i mean who are you to knock what youve never experienced
thats a first most people praised me for it
i must say i found it rather appalling
you did
i read your teen beat manifesto
i was just being honest you happen to have a nice ass sorry
are you often this offensive on a first encounter
no
you a lesbo
i dont know relationships seem too distracting id rather concentrate on my studies
why not
no
got a boyfriend back home
junior

screening calls any suggestions

moving along quite well
i hate it too
i hate when things dont go my way it makes me so horny
oh sis youre so tense
thank you mmmm that feels good
im at your service
but who will they turn to for help
i rat cecile out to mommy mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship boo hoo
whats your plan of attack
not to mention court reynolds unfortunately ronalds moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder
ooo im sure mrs caldwell will love that
the plot thickens it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher
call cecile up and get her to come over ill bust that cherry in a heartbeat
no
i now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag any luck corrupting her daughter
interesting
you ready for this ive recently discovered that our good friend mrs caldwell is the one who sent the letter to annette urging her to stay away from me
whats wrong with you
shhh
you would not believe what
okay
call me later
blow me
loser
im working on it

it would feel so yummy
even there
you can put it anywhere
because im the only person you cant control and it kills you
what makes you think id go for that bet thats a seventy thousand dollar car
in english ill fuck your brains out
be more specific
ill give you something youve been jerking off about ever since our parents got married
and if i win
if you lose then that hot little porsche of yours is mine
what are the terms
could you be more desperate to read it
oh gee your journal could you be more queer
oh well duty calls time to add another chapter to my work of art
ill think about it
care to make a wager on that
you dont stand a chance even this is out of your league
it just so happens were not in kansas anymore our little angels father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood shes staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house can you imagine what this would do for my reputation screwing the new headmasters virginal daughter before school starts it will be my greatest victory
bfd what do you plan to do fly to kansas and woo little dorothy
oh yes ive read it over and over again this babys the real deal daddys little angel a paradigm of chastity and virtue
jesus christ is she for real
shut up and turn to page
im not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas
that was just simple revenge what i have planned requires sheer genius
oh but diddling the therapists daughter is a challenge
oh come on kathryn its too easy but i thought high school was only four years i mean please she knows nothing shes seen nothing i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it i have a reputation to uphold
why not
shes quite cute you know young supple breasts a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie
sounds intriguing
i need you to seduce our young cecile introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery
i see your point though why should i care
because if theres an attack made on court it could be traced back to me i cant allow that to happen everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way
why go through cecile why not just attack court
keep your friends close and your enemies closer when i get through with her shell be the premier blow job queen of the tristate area and poor little courts heart will be shattered
so thats what this is all about well get together and plan your curriculum
i dont find this very funny
you dont mean
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else someone chaste pure innocent
sorry

oh poor baby well you can relax i have a mission for you
hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid

i can kill a hundred ordinary people
bob
hes not a president hes an ordinary person i can kill an ordinary person
you cant kill a president
im going to kill him
what are you gonna do
i dont think so

youre kidding
and look at this russell came around on the trade bill
alan we still have to control this guy

weve got nothing bob this wont work
nobodys got clean kids
clean
check his kids
clean
what about the wife

clean
i just hope this yutz can pull it off
everybody else is buying the minor stroke story

duanes guys but hes got them under control
is that everybody
i got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred the older one wanted head of the cdc
what about containment alan
oh i know and then when our poor president gets another stroke of course much more serious this time the newly appointed vp becomes the pres
i was a senator you know
you mean we get dave to nominate you as vice president
its simple alan we send the vice president to africa or something dig up some dirt on him force him to resign and get our president to nominate a new one the whole thing takes a few weeks tops
do you know how many different kinds of laws weve broken
yes
we think so
exactly a condition
a condition
soon
up and around soon
yes and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon
mild stroke
well start by going on television and saying that hes had a mild stroke
like how

bob the guy had a stroke
tilt we figure something out
till what
this is mine al all mine i made him i built him and no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be vice president of the united states

its alright i know what you mean lets start at the top
well theres lots of places where i think you can save but im not the one whos i mean im not the one whos not the pres
so what do we do
yeah thats how you end up with a billion dollar deficit
you could buy it on payments
you know priorities remember when you couldnt get your car fixed cause you wanted to get that piano
choices
well yeah but you gotta start making some choices
im not surprised can we save anywhere
i just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be
im not sure
i gotta tell ya dave ive been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesnt add up who does these books
im not sure
i gotta tell ya dave ive been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesnt add up who does these books
i am the government
the government
and whos gonna find out
this is undeclared income
i dont think so
why would they do that they hired me
they could put you in jail
its fine
im serious dave you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this
oh okay ill catch ya tomorrow then
i was gonna do something with joan
oh yeah me too you want to get dinner later
dave im working
so you want to go swimming
hes not
now hes making stuff up about me
she knows
dave
absolutely well that might be kind of tough once the press starts smelling blood
weve got to fix this
oh i know i know it looks awfully bad its really embarrassing but it was bobs idea
alan
wrong
this is wrong alan
we had to dave the guys a choir boy
what do you mean you made it all up
right we can pick up on the rest tomorrow
lets call it a night i cant take any more
but we went there we saw those kids

we vetoed that
president vetoes works bill
quick gimme a quarter
what
gimme a quarter
fine
fine
she hardly ever sees him and itll be so fast she wont have a chance to tell
yeah but the first lady couldnt we start with a cousin or something
its just five minutes she comes in you wave to the press she leaves
i thought you said i wasnt going to see her
its in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down
dave
america isnt in what we say here tonight its in the faces and the smiles of a sunday afternoon hand on the heart
dave
somewhere there is a distant light guiding us through this rocky shoal
thanks i wrote it
thats at a press conference otherwise he just puts em right out there
what
at a press conference
right now whenever he stands at a podium the president always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat
presence
oh
i dont think so
the teleprompter is it hooked up
what
a teleprompter
now some of this may feel a bit strange at first you gotta remember that even a professional politician has some trouble getting used to
i see what you mean
in the car
in the car
now lets say the whole country was in that car the entire united states of america
well i gues i would yeah
well lets say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital youd do it then for sure wouldnt you
im not sure i might have
you know on an empty road where you know its safe and nobodys around
really crazy
im afraid so
no
oh yeah probably
will he be alright
oh my gosh
its actually kind of serious dave im afraid the presidents not in very good shape
well its its sort of an an incident really
what happened
i know i know its difficult for all of us but sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gqod of the country
oh my god
extend them cmere for a second
extend things
in fact we think you did such a good job wed like to extend things a little bit
were not upset with you dave we think you did a terrific job dont we
look im sorry i know you said not to talk but when i saw the crowd i just got excited
now dave something has come up and i think we need to talk about it
oh yeah m fine
you sure a coke or a perrier or something
well im sure thats really important but i dont want to tell some eight yearold kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars do you want to tell him that
yes but i wouldnt
so were spending fortyseven million dollars to make people feel better about a car theyve already bought
well to shore up product identification and preserve market share
why
yes its designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase
perceptual
no sir its more of a perceptual issue
does it make the cars any better
and its proving quite effective
youre spending fortythree million dollars on an ad campaign to boost consumer confidence in the american auto industry
yes mr president
oh kinda the same way
howd you get started
my wife was my campaign manager we had a two thousand dollar budget
really
one day my wife says to me why dont you try running for office you talk about it all the time why dont you just do it so i tell my boss i have a dentist appointment and i go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break next thing i know im a councilman
you know your first campaign
what
you ever think back to how you started
yeah sometimes they do
sometimes they do
hes not gonna win not in the end they never do
yeah
dirty business were in sometimes
oh hi
i just fired bob alexander
what do you mean
they re not my attack dogs
all ive got is my integrity thats all i have now i dont know why you turned your attack dogs on me
the fidelity nonsense
oh come on were not children i didnt have anything to do with this fidelity nonsense and you know it
something like what
certainly
mr president may i speak frankly with you
ah
fertility beads
what are they
and these are a gift from the king of to go
oh thanks

youre kidding
first thing they teach you at the academy dont give me gold and silver or other worldly things just the pride and glory of bleeding for my king
whats that
bleed for your king
you mean with you and everything
i had a feeling
i was waiting for that jack
but its tenthirty at night
call bob and reed tell them i need them immediately
certainly
well is that really true i mean would you really get killed just to save his life
what about it
huh you know what i always wondered the way they say you guysd take a bullet for the president
no
you ever use it
of course
you got a gun
yeah
so you just protect the president the whole time thats your whole job
oh
i cant say
you mean you dont know or like you cant say
i cant say
so how long have they been like that you know him and the first lady
really
wed like to hire you
really
on occasion for security purposes to double for the president at the secret service hires someone public functions and exposed situations
what
your government needs your help

you really believe that
yeah but we got a little bit done and if you do a little and i do a little then maybe the next guyll do a little
theyre crucifying you out there
looks like were not going to get a chance to get much done
whats wrong
thats okay
i mean i want to i just i feel strange
i know im sorry

ellen
theres no mistake bill if you veto their funding its not a mistake if you hurt someone intentionally its not a mistake
look if there was some mistake
you made their funding disappear
whats wrong with a magic trick
thats not just a works bill you vetoed that would have given these kids homes when i think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick
i dont understand
you know if you want to be the same old bastard thats fine i can handle it but dont pull this man of the people bullshit and then do something like this
oh come on bill dont patronize me im not one of your little turn around im talking to you turnaround

whats the matter with you
those maps belong to his majestys government theyre confidential they shouldnt be left lying around for any tom dick or mary to have sight of
in my room
and where are the expedition maps
which we couldnt explore because of rocks because of crosswinds its sloppy and here and here we could be staring at zerzura
which weve overflown twice
no because you cant see from the air if you could explore from the air life would be very simple look what is that is that a wadi that whole spur is a real possibility
and im telling you theres nothing there to explore
bermann

no
so you can shoot a pistol
id like to stay thats the long and short of it i mean you know blahblah if its convenient if theres room blahblahblah i have to do some work here i speak the language there are partisans to be we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons you know while we hug i was a thief so they think id be good at that
so was my patient
yeah for a while
you were in africa
theyre fresh i havent eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens you get chickens in italy but no eggs in africa there were always eggs but never chickens who separates them
bonjour
i met your friend mary she said i should stop and see if you were okay apparently were neighbors my house is two blocks from yours in montreal cabot north of laurier bonjour
what do you want
are you hana
buon giorno hana turns startled and suspicious
no now i cant kill you
you cant kill me i died years ago
you get to the morning and the poison leaks away doesnt it black nights fucking black nights when you want to howl like a dog i thought i would kill you you killed my friends you ruined my hands but the girl was always here like some guardian angel
yes i got back there finally to keep my promise to come back for her and then of course i couldnt i couldnt even do that properly
and did you never see katharine you never got back to the cave
is that what you thought that i betrayed the british the british betrayed me the british betrayed me
but you were among the british they were your friends why betray them
thousands of people did die just different people
there was a result to what you did it wasnt just another expedition it did this if the british hadnt unearthed your nosey photographer in cairo thousands of people could have died
the rest meant nothing to me
what did you say
i had to get back to the desert i made a promise the rest meant nothing to me
you were the only man who knew the desert well enough the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing
and you thought youd come and settle the score
before you went over to the germans before you got rommels spy across the desert and inside british headquarters he took some pretty good photographs i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk so they made an impression
i see
id seen you writing in that book at the embassy in cairo when i had thumbs and you had a face and a name
me
so i come across the hospital convoy i was looking for this stuff and some nurse mary hanas friend tells me about you and hana hiding in a monastery in purdah whatever it is retreat how youd come in from the desert and you were burned and you didnt know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession a copy of herodotus and it was full of letters and cuttings and then i knew it must be you
we shall miss you
there are going to be trials they want me to interpret dont they know im allergic to courtrooms
hana tells me youre leaving
what
what you and madox or you and katharine clifton
very true
well anything you do is likely to be fatal so you know
ive had a drink fatal
have a drink
is there a song you dont know
top hat
for
irving berlin
what hana comes in sleepily frowns at the gramophone
thought youd never wake up
i dont know paper is it paper i dont remember
first wedding anniversary what do you call it
moose
is it you if i said moose i look different fuck why shouldnt you
i dont even know if it is my book the bedouin found it in the plane in the wreckage its mine now i heard your breathing and thought it might be rain im dying for rain of course im dying anyway but i long to feel rain on my face
why do i feel if i had your book i would know everything
i cant hide anymore i breathe like a dog i lose my balance stealings got harder caravaggio stares at the herodotus
are you outside a beat and then caravaggio shuffles in like an old boxer
i told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name
i told her you would never invent such a preposterous name
and youve forgotten yours
me youve got the wrong end of the stick old boy so caravaggio hana thinks you invented your name
are you planning to be the exception
i think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her
all over i kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed are you leaving us nows our opportunity to swap war wounds
oh all over
i understand you were in africa whereabouts
thief i think is more accurate
finally so youre our canadian pickpocket
hello
have to return the favor take a few photographs for the army
did katharine say geoffrey has to fly back to cairo
to armtwisting
and a special thank you to geoffrey and katharine without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels they toast the cliftons
very much so we are all save my friend here
good heavens are you married madox
i wont hear of it none of us will
oh no really she has her book
of course well we should all go out onto the terrace
this is clive fenelonbarnes
apprentices
i think you know all of us except for geoffrey and katharine clifton whove recently come out from england
we can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap almsy smiles and walks on towards the others
isnt it wedding present from katharines parents im calling it rupert bear hello geoffrey clifton
marvelous plane did you look
so one day well meet
ill always go back to that church
ill always go back to that church look at my painting
then come with me
ive clung to you ive clung to you kip life a raft
im thinking about your heart not your skin and how to reach it and that i dont think i can a bomb has ruined us just not the bomb i thought would ruin us
its what ive learned
is that what you think is that what you think i think
i know here i am always a brown man there you would be always a white woman
kip i
i mean home india
of course when
will you come with me
nyanyanya
this is hot
the lamp was burning all night in his room caravaggio was there with him
i should go to the house get breakfast
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on the waste id been taught to reuse everything the dung from a cow to cool a radiator a fork to fix a typewriter india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away
that gun at lahor kiplings cannon zamzammah remember that was made out of the metal of ordinary things i want to make an ordinary thing out of guns his bayonet is thrust into the forge its red hot
what are you up to
you wouldnt come to find me that makes me never want to come here but she continues unraveling the turban
then id think there must be a reason
but if it got late and i hadnt shown up
i try not to expect you
if one night i didnt come to the tent what would you do
you loved him
i was thinking yesterday yesterday the patient hardy theyre everything thats good about england i couldnt even say what that was we didnt exchange two personal words and weve been together through some terrible things some he was engaged to a girl in the village i mean and us he never once he didnt ask me if i could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or i dont even know what im talking about
yes later
kip come and dance with me
this is what i do i do this every day
dont go im frightened i can love a coward i cant love another dead man
dont talk check again lie flat and then cut
kiss me before i cut just in case
no but he hands them over
actually you cant cut can you youll fall over give me the pliers
you must get away before i cut im not cutting if youre here hes struggling hes going to topple over if he cuts
im not scared so many people have died around me but i would be a shame for us i dont feel like being shy
okay get away from here quick
i promise you that was the right thing to do hes my good luck now cut this one i hope we dont die
what is this business with you and explosives do you think youre immune
ive done this ive had to do this
why would anyone do this
i follow the wires
you get hardy
so i follow the wires
theres a mine here but the others are far enough away i think at least to give me a chance i have to work out which one to cut before i fall over
what do i do
the mines the wires theres a trick some explode if you stretch the wires some if you cut them
its okay ill help please
i didnt like that book either its all about men too many men just like this house
ill get another tin hana and the patient are alone
yes for your hair
for my hair
thank you
try this i found a great jar of it olive oil in naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife
i dont think so
ive met you before
no but no not at all im sorry you came to the doors thats all and such good manners for someone worried about mines thats all
is something funny
i see then may be youre safe as long as you only play bach hes german kip is looking around the piano hana giggles
the germans were here the germans were all over this area they left mines everywhere pianos were their favorite hiding places
excuse me yes i dont have the key to that door
this is making me incredibly angry
yessir
go away
youve got to cut sir that frost wont last
im afraid so sir kip hurries to his tent hana follows him
whats happening am i needed
dont move stand absolutely still hana stops
hey hey stop hey
i insist there clearly isnt room for us all im the least able to dig and im not one of the walking wounded those are facts besides if i remain its the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever hes doing and rescue us its hard to argue with this logic
certainly not
why not
darling peter says i could stay
a more modest expedition or even wait a year remind our families we still exist
how awful what will you do
im afraid were not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition
not at all i was thoroughly enjoying by book please signor dagostino herr bermann
mrs clifton youll have to forgive us were not accustomed to the company of women
it doesnt matter really i think i can muddle through okay the story of candaules and gyges king candaules was passionately in love with his wife one day he said to gyges the son of somebody anyway his favorite warrior
your book your herodotus almsy looks uncomfortable
go on do it i dont need to hear any more
theyre excited theyre happy about destroying a whole city would they do that to a white mans city never
what have i been doing all this time do you know how many mines ive seen more mines than there are soldiers more how many mines weve put in the ground ourselves stuffed in corpses dropped out of the sky and now this
what are you talking about
i looked up to you uncle my brother always said i was a fool never trust the british he said the dealmakers the mapmakers never shake hands with them
kip
whats he saying
this is wonderful
hana we have discovered a shared please the boy and i
what i really object to uncle is your finishing all my condensed milk and the message everywhere in your book however slowly i read it that the best destiny for india is to be ruled by the british
so what do you really object to the writer or what hes writing about
its still there the cannon outside the museum it was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax then melted down then later they fired the cannon at my people comma the natives
the wonder house comma as the natives called the lahore museum
brick platform opposite the old ajaibgher
im going to get him i promise you
tell me where you are or just leave the line open so i can trace you
too late now
listen to me whatever youre doing stop pull out
hes on to something bigger
in the middle youve got the mask why dont we have him
im in the middle
gin where the hell are you
ill send you a postcard got to go
where are you at least
look trust me i know what im doing
dont overestimate yourself
you want to blow the whole thing go right ahead
this is dangerous im sending backup
i dont know but close
how close
were getting close
yeah yeah yeah whats the status
this was my first excuse to get away i cant exactly use my cell phone
you dont call you dont write
which you have in mind
and a target guaranteed to catch his interest
thats doable
id need an introduction from someone he trusts someone who owes us a favor
how would you approach him hello mr macdougal im gin would you steal a painting with me
ive been following this guy for years im your best shot
with that computernobody better out thereits different you twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on madison avenue
its not the thinking of it its the doing it
why didnt i think of that
weve got to catch him in the act
yeah me
you got a better idea
theyve never caught him before what makes you think theyll catch him now
exactly
youre saying the thief wants us to think its mac but its really not
give me a break remember manzini when he stole montezumas scepter he left a pepto bismal bottle the best ones always copy mac
macs signature
put the bolts on that window under a scope im betting youll find wrench scratches on them
and the draft blew over the flowers
meaning no one arranges calalilies like that he left the window open when he came in his only mistake
meaning
let a thousand flowers bloom chairman mao
you ordering chop suey again
interesting theory wheres the proof
he unscrewed the bolts reset them on rollers then slid the whole frame away no more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor
thats great if youre a computer in the real world that pane weighs pounds the buildings feet high
bingo
so he popped the pane
entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm
the windows dont open
through a window
a thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms what we dont get is how he effectuated his entry
i dont recall asking your permission
i dont recall authorizing you to have a personal life
i hardly knew the guy why be impolite to strangers
you didnt answer the beeper either
there are times when you dont answer the phone
where were you i called at this morning
you mean the seven billion
you gave them the eight billion
theyve been on to you all along knew you had a big job going
that would be thibadeaux the cop i work for every now and then catching thieves the really good onesthe ones who imitate me
he looks familiar
both sides of the street im afraid
youre a cop
my god
you have the right to remain silent but anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you
what about you
its only ninety seconds up the line youre on a connection to a trans siberian express
but
take the airport subway but change at jordan station for kowloon tong
nothing is wrong everything is the way it has to be in my left coat pocket is a packet passports hotel reservations tickets
whats wrong
im not leaving without you
put this on
no you cant
i cannot get rid of you
get out of here
hang on
go
no way
come on
you can do it
jesus
i sincerely hope not
the doors the only way out
we cant help it weweve gotta
the disc is still in there
move it what are you waiting f
we cant leave it in there its got all our accounts everything that can nail us to a goddam cross
dont panic now theres no rush
fucking thing
relax dont jam it
hong kong midnight happy new year except at china bank
jesus god its going through
theyll each be positive the other guy did it i fear an ugly international incident
china will think it happened before midnight britain will swear it happened after midnight
and when eventually everyone discovers what transaction xj was really about
brought us luck once maybe it will again
the sign of our partnership
im leaving from the nathan road station at tomorrow morning you could come too
they drive so recklessly there
im going to disappear i die in a car crash in taiwan very easy to do
what another job stealing the eiffel tower
not for me
a flaw in your research my dear i grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast
thats because you grew up rich
seen one billion seen them all
four billion dollars
oh i dont care about the money
so what are you going to do with your share
im sorry
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention
of course not it was just a negotiating ploy
have really held you under
but would youwould you
but thats all behind us now
it was wrong to deceive you
that was a lifetime ago
call it a new tradition
you have something in mind
there is one more thing
cant break tradition its bad luck
you shouldnt have
no youll see when we get inside
no way to take another day or two
surgically attached
done and i assume you have the magic cd rom
packed
parachute
charged
pulse detectors
let me guess his retinal plate is in there
two men in the world dont need passwords or codes their retinas will scan to unlock everything one of those two men is the chairman of the bank
cant be too careful
access codes to the vault are changed daily passwords for our computer on the hour
like a woman of mystery
how do i look
feeling old
for gods sake the only way i can get from one elevator to the other is to jump
look theres a video security system to bypass thats the only hard part youve done that a dozen times
youre overestimating yourself again whats worse this time youre overestimating me
ive covered everything and youre the best so
theres always a surprise
theres no way to practice this and no time besides ive planned it all there arent any surprises
youre out of your mind we cant do a job like this with no rehearsal
thats the beauty of it theres only one tiny window of time when this will work at the handover of hong kongfrom britain to china the handover from them to us
you cant be serious
were doing it tonight
so how long till we do this
youve thought of everything
thats where the mask comes in
then the vault how to get in the vault thats stumping me
got it
its no good without the argon gas
the oscilloscopes already programmed
sit down ill show you how were going to do it
a parting gift from the empire
nope the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj
but those instructions theyre recorded in the computer
every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches as soon as each deposit lands somewhere its shot somewhere else it ends up so clean the mafia couldnt find it
and the money goes
its taken me five years at webber insurance nights weekends every spare minute to make this cd it has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts two or three million at a crack total eight billion and change
where the money is
peoples china bank
guest lists of every alist party on turnover night theyd be handy to disappear into so were invited to all of them
whats that
right the eight billion
the eight billion from them to us
transfer
currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer
youre being useless im making us rich
wellwhat are we doing
my job my rules
what about the rules
id taken the mask
oh my god i thought
would you quiet down just for a minute
do you know what youve done do you know
you took the rembrandt i figured it was a fair trade
the mask where is it
theres food in the fridge i wont be long
idle hands the devils workshop
everyone has secrets its what makes us human
okay look im delivering this to a man whos going to give us the key to our job but its pointless to try to explain it yet you just have to trust me i dont have any more secrets
insidious thing wondering if your partnerhas another partner
i told you its the down payment and thanks to you its overdue
sure its only worth million or so dont bother telling me what youre going to do with it
ill need the rembrandt now
everything
youve got everything planned
i always knew youd do the job
hmmm long
hold the record alone
come on what can you do with six billion you cant do with four
its fiftyfifty less the cost of the dress
my eighty your twenty smart guy
no really its your plan you should get at least per cent
okay
if you want a partner i think you should recalculate the split
speaking of money you said billions how many
i like banks thats where the money is
you dont know the half of it
were living history here
get the hell in
your share
a billion dollars
what
there is no big job
the big job
its your mistake
stop youre makingmistake
what do i need a thief for ive got the mask
yes yes
okay youre a thief
no no please god youre wrong im a thief just like you
youre playing both sides of the street youre going to keep the mask and turn me in
what
nows when you tell me who you really are

shut up
carefulcareful
duh
be careful not to break the laser beams
behind you
they moved it
got it

ready
ready
yes you can you can spoil a perfectly nice dance
you cant be too careful
these rooms are solid stone they havent changed
dont turn im counting the steps to the entrance
youre not on the beat
one two three
lets mingle a little shall we
its a party
were working
in eye of that painting
popup on floorboards and
bookshelf sensors
camera in the
he pulled back his arms and blam i landed right on the floor i picked myself up tears in my eyes and he looked at me and he said son dont ever trust anybody anybody
and
something like that
so you had to be your own lifeline
he wasnt
my father told me not to be afraid hed always be there for me
arent we all
i had a lifeline if ive got a lifeline im okay
how in the devil did you do the rembrandt then
terrified still am
you were afraid of heights
when i was a girl my father took me to the edge of el capitan three thousand feet of granite straight down i was so scared my mouth was full of cotton i couldnt talk just stood there shiveringlike this
youre nervous again
to ourpartnership
to us to the mask
little celebration before we set off
arent we early
ive got something for you
certainly the most beautiful crook ive ever seen
straight down the drive right at the hedgerow follow the lane dont blink youll miss it
wont take any time
its not a village theres nothing there
no no i want to ill just go into the village
thank you
thank you
dont get any ideas of course it comes out of your share
you bought this for me
itsbeautiful
i trust its your size
one more itemnot on the check list
thats it were ready
charged receiver
charged
got it
the lipstick thermal camera
a dozen times
and youve checked the ram to be sure its synchronized with the clock
twenty four secondsas long as it takes the clock to strike twelve
so how long to pop the floor
yes you did
i didnt mean to get personal
it was a long time ago
all this this is a womans version of what you would like
hmmm
our equipment has arrived
did i hear a car
try laps say a hundred
lets do it again
we arefor the tools
why dont we take oxygen
oh i think you can do it probably
so youre testing umeu now
lets just see how we do
so the mask is part of the down payment too must be a really big job
without the mask it doesnt matter
a partner with secrets isnt much of a partner
we get the mask ill tell you
on what another job
no its a down payment
dont worry i can get rid of this no trace and ill even go fifty fifty were partners arent we
this isnt a good time to hear your personal philosophy
no one uneedsu anything except food and shelter the rest we just want
ill need that
youre too easily impressed with yourself i believe ive made that point before
someone was expecting that
it was perfect
the rembrandtthat was quite good
you need a partner for this job youll never find one as good as me
true enough
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window it was the only way to bypass the smart glass
i wondered whod been giving me a bad name
thats because i wanted them to
nice try everyone thinks i did
no dammit i mean me that rembrandtthat rembrandt
a lifelong problem im afraid
you dont have any idea how lucky you are
this isnt some picasso print you steal out of a car dealers rec room
look i can help you need a sensor expert youve got one
pack up ill see you get back to london
you dont get the mask code unless i go
i go in alone
precisely you give me the mask security code i steal the mask you get a finders fee at ten percent should be two or three million at least not too bad
were doing this together were partners
we are you implying that im taking you inside
we go underwater
so the duke dug a tunneljust in case they made the lake a hundred years later flooded the tunnel
thats when well do it and well need every single day
theyre having a farewell party the last night before the mask goes back to taiwan
only a week
in a week
years ago if memory serves when does the exhibit end
as i recall youve robbed it before
i know it well
it is coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen well start in twenty minutes
nice spot
good morning
and good morning
uimu dressed
youre late
my job my rules weve got a job to do no mixing business and pleasure
why are we in separateyou know separate rooms
i guess i have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do
nothing you dont even lock the door
hmmm id be surprised if you could
im impressed cant spot a thing
and
im just curious what sort of security system youd have in your own house
lose something
you really dont believe id take on a partner after all these years without a littleinsurance
whats my problem you want a list
whats your problem im doing the job
i dont believe this
no entrapment is what cops do to robbers
thats entrapment
wheres my bag

takes a lot out of you one like this
we wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces you know and they dont come off but when you find the one person who really knows you and then you lose her
my friend you always surprise me
did i ever tell you what tina wrote the night she died
i really dont think thats a topic on which you have much to offer
you got a real problem with priorities you know that
the face decays the mask doesnt art lasts we dont thats why arts so valuable its a little piece of immortality
i figured that out
take this mask it may look like the empress but its not
you dont really think id leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag what matters isnt whats real its what we uthinku is realwhat matters is the art
thought you had to use some of these
call it an expression of trust
youre giving them to me
thirtyfive next generation microchips copper not silicon value one million each
she wont tell me everything its a bank job thats all i know
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin i got to have trust
youll just have to have faith
to yourself thats where
you know where my loyalties lie
you better be keeping your mind on business its not just me you got to worry about ive got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder
its never happened before what makes you think its happening now
my antenna is up it is fully extended and i am picking upwhat is it it is can it be the boy is in el u v
she reminds you of yourself theres nobody you admire more
shes good give her that almost as good as she thinks she is
youre impressed with her arent you
shes calling the shots now
im waiting for the tell part
this is just show and tell
thats because we live in the future which is whats on my mind
its not just art its history something you americans dont care aboutbecause you havent got any
doesnt look like much how come those commos want it so bad
check out my ball
tonight your league night
im terribly sorry old man
you damn well thought wrong
oh look at me darling i thought this gentleman was a waiter
you change partners you change the rules
suspicious after all these years
you better not be taking on a new partner
were supposed to
you two make quite a couple
because it pays off
remind me why
so patience thibeau patience trust me
but the second mouse gets the cheese
the early bird gets the damn worm
its too soon
i cannot tell you a goddamned lie shes selling you a pig in a poke we better do this tonight
you look like george washington
how the hell im supposed to know the damn difference
i said a masked ball not a costume party
it better be worth it for me
oh it is
this better be worth t
id say shes a size who wears a size
black of course
thats it i sure as hell aint no personal shopper
i need you to get one more thing for me a dress elegant but sexy something grace kelly would wear maybe a balenciaga
because i never assume anything
right
its a death mask death mask means dead
let me ask you this mask when they made itwas the old bitch dead or alive
its never big enough
this is big enough
we might not want to cash in our chips just yet she has another job after this one a big one
you are a miracle worker
inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days
if we dont bypass it the temperature in the mask room will change and set off the alarm that would be inconvenient
sure wouldnt want you to be uncomfortable
were going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust the air filters might be wired and a bypass hose for the ac
youre not the one trying to get all this shit you think theyve just got a crooks r us on every corner
the key to success is using the right tools
had to get a liquid plasma screen
the porta powercomm kitsgot the irthermo camera
and you do it so well
yeah the lord of the manor doesnt haul his own groceries
id give you a hand but it wouldnt look good
dont go getting sentimental youre no damn good at it

mr masry before you go off on some crusade you might want to remember who it is youre dealing with here pge is a billion dollar corporation
is all im authorized to offer
wait a minute i thought we were negotiating here
a million things could have caused those problems poor diet bad genes irresponsible lifestyle our offer is final and more than fair
youre kidding right look at these readings for christs sake pges own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells on numerous occasions
i understand theyve had a bad run of luck healthwise and they have my sympathies but thats not pges fault
what about in terms of medical expenses doesnt come close to what this familys gonna have to spend on doctors
in terms of land value out in hinkley mr masry we feel its a more than fair price
""
all of them

the extortion the threats

oh okay here it comes
yeah yours is nicer
you see your office
careful you dont spit from here you could kill someone
cause you got a little voice in your head saying do the right thing give him another chance
how do you know that
but i know youre not gonna quit on me
the luckiest son of a bitch in the universe erin the luckiest son of a bitch in history
say youd be the luckiest son of a bitch on earth if i didnt up and quit over all this
i did both
say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself
i was wrong
say you were wrong
i dont know what to say
oh now dont get all jealous ed i got a little something for you too
ho ly shit
you know what mr potter i completely forgot your birthday this year and seeing as how youve been so good to me i think that is a terrible oversight so what i been doing over the last few days is ive been putting together a present for you
erin what are you
morning
no im serious you know what kurt potter is hes the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place hes the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pge offered million he doesnt work like us ed theres no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing
erin
fuck kurt
because kurt doesnt want to work with you he thinks youre a loose cannon
why not
this isnt doctors orders its mine im saying you cant come
the fuck im not i dont care what the doctor says
youre not gonna be there
okay good i think i should be the one to tell em cause they trust me more than
tuesday at seven at the hinkley firehouse
when where
ui knowu were having a meeting its all set up
fuck legal terms were talking about human beings here sick people a whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years they need their money now we gotta get em to agree to the arbitration ed we gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to
hey thats not so bad compare it to the love canal that was twenty years ago and those people still havent seen a dime so in legal terms ten years is
im sorry are you saying that if this thing goes to trial itll be uten yearsu before these plaintiffs see their money
five years maybe for a trial double that for the appeal
wait what do you mean ten years
because they know the evidence they know theyre gonna lose a jury trial maybe they wouldnt lose million bucks but once you factor in all theyd spend on this case in the next ten years it makes a lot of
so why would pge offer it
with nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet id say well end up on the lower end of that still a lot of money
and if you had to guess
uhhuh
between and million definitely
i know im sorry do i get to hear what happened anyway
im not gonna fire you i wanted to but then you got sick and that woulda made me look like a shit you embarrassed me erin
if youre here to fire me your timings lousy
perks jesus uperksu
dont give me that youve gotten plenty youve been wellpaid youve gotten lots of perks
bullshit you stuck me in siberia dictating to some god damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me after all ive done for you thats the thanks i get
no ones taking anything
how dare you take that away from me
unot personalu thats my uworku in there ed my sweat my labor my time if thats not personal i dont know what is
okay now youre making this personal and it isnt
fun jesus ufunu i kill myself for a year and a half hand you the best case of your life on a god damn silver platter remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place and you think of me as fun
youre emotional youre erratic you say any god damn thing that comes into your head and im not saying thats bad that can be great that can be a lot of fun
and what im not serious
look this is serious now theyre talking serious money
kurt thought what about you do you think anymore
okay look its an important meeting kurt thought if it was just lawyers
bullshit youd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you
look you said you werent feeling great i thought you should rest
people dont fly down in their own god damn plane for just a meeting
erin its just a meeting
if you tell me to relax im gonna kick your fucking head off
gee i wonder why
not in my world
because uthats how people treat each otheru
why the fuck should i respect her
bullshit it was a misunderstanding but instead of handling it politely instead of treating her with respect
she insulted me
hes got a reputation for doing all his
why good
reasons pge thinks it shouldnt go to
counts
its pge saying to the judge that we dont have a case their lawyers go
whats a demur
dont joke they might so do me a favor and behave yourself for once ed masry to see kurt potter
holy shit who do they represent god
its eight million dollars erin eight million dollars
plus percent of millions a whole lot of money
maybe but maybe not we still dont have anything linking this to pge corporate plus theres the statute problem plus were way short on manpower so wed need to bring on more lawyers
do you think wed do better by going to trial
and its less than pocket change for pge
but it wont cover annabelle danielss medical bills
im thinking i wish someone else had to make this decision thousand bucks is more than any other california toxic plaintiff has gotten ever but
so what are you thinking
its about thousand per plaintiff
whoa no shit
things like the head counsel for pge calling me with an offer million plus attorneys fees take it or leave it
what kind of things come up
you might want to think real hard about the amount too my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now cause i still dont make enough to afford good child care makes me think about looking around for a job where im appreciated for shits sake
ill see what i can do
i want my paycheck by the end of the day
is that what you want
fuck you make time cause i bust my ass for you i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet for you and what do you do for me huh you see the way im treated around here but have you ever stood up for me once have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work im doing have you ever bothered saying hey erin doesnt get paid the most cause she has the best tits she gets paid the most cause shes the best god damn employee ive ever had
erin youre a big girl if you got a problem with jane work it out for yourself i dont have time to deal with
its my paycheck which i earned which i deserve which i shouldnt have to beg for that fatass bitch wont give it to me
oh jesus you wanna tell me what the problem is here or
yeah i mind you bet your ass i mind
im sorry im gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here do you mind
i want my fucking money
yeah yeah im fine
i was just asking are you all right
no ed what with me running for my life i didnt have time to check those things
hes gone did you get a license plate or a make
i dont know big dark
what kind of truck
some guy in a truck he waited till i was alone then he followed me like two miles jesus im shaking get me a beer
what who
someones following me
boy this job takes me to some of the best damn places huh
he said hed be at the gas station at six
dyou get his name course not jesus ed
hey a new plaintiff called wants to meet you i told him wed be out there thursday
theyre trying to intimidate us tell them to wait in the conference room
jesus they look like the secret service
yeah i heard that one before
from their tone of voice on the phone id say theyre taking us more seriously
if theyve sent that little shmuck baum again im gonna be real pissed off
well good ed i like working with you too
hey i like working with you
i would now
you didnt care about my case
me too thats why i like it its been a long time since i had a case i cared about
really it makes me sick
i like this case
jesus christ ed you know the more i work on this thing the more i realize what a crock of shit this legal system is here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer that built a pool for a town then filled it with toxic water and uwereu the ones whove gotta bust our ass proving things thats just not right
then they didnt know and if they didnt know we cant hit em for punitive damages and punitive damages is where the money is
show me the document that proves that
oh they knew they had to know
pge corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in hinkley
what do you mean
weve got the pge fuckers in hinkley by the balls but nobodys getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate pge fuckers in san francisco
dont give me that youre gonna get plenty rich off of this mr percent we got those pge fuckers by the balls here
hey i got a staff to pay plus rent plus i havent billed a minute of my time since i started on this case so you can quit hitting me up like im rich or something
yeah then gimme another raise
erin lemme tell you something if ida put three researchers on this i wouldnt expect them to dig up all the information you got here this is some damn good work
no
no shit
for your information frank cares what was in those ponds cause he used to spend half his day wading around them that was his job
jesus i dont even wanna ask what you did to make this melendez guy talk
i guess it was a little too inconvenient so for fourteen years this stuff flowed into the groundwater free as you please
they skipped that step
see according to this they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldnt seep into the ground but guess what
it didnt help but no the real problems on the bottom
and thats what caused the contamination
they covered em over and not too carefully either cause you dig one inch under the surface and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock
i dont remember seeing any ponds up there
they used the hex chrom here in these cooling tanks as an anticorrosive then they dumped it here in these six ponds
unou
you wanna talk about
she lived on the plume you never know
is that what i think it is
another raise wouldnt hurt and with all the time im gonna be spending on the road ill probably be needing my own cel phone wont i
what now
yeah yeah remind me of that when im filing for bankruptcy
youre doing the right thing mr masry
kinda like david and whatshisnames whole fucking family okay heres the deal if and only if you find me the evidence to back all this up ill do it ill take it on
kinda like david and whatshisname
this is a whole different ball game erin a much bigger deal
well i found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from a hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then
you think theres more
four more eleven people so far
how many families we talking about here
okay fine i dont know shit about shit but i know the difference
oh you do with all your legal expertise you believe that
we can get these people with a little effort i really think we can nail their asses to the wall
i know how dna works erin
and this shit is bad news mr masry not only does it attack every organ of the body it fucks with your dna too that means these peoples genes and the genes of their kids and the genes of their grandkids
who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it
its about being realistic something like this erin it could take forever theyre a huge corporation theyd completely bury us in paperwork im just one guy with a shitty little pi firm
bullshit
its not about working hard
okay so heres what ill do ill go on up to ted and rita daniels two of the nicest people youd ever hope to meet who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer ill tell them we cant help them cause you dont feel like working that hard
because i said no look the only reason pges even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute we add plaintiffs and suddenly were in the middle of a toxic tort with a statute problem against a massive utility no thank you
thats crazy why not
hunhuh absolutely not
and i realized hes taking a chance too
then i dont get anything either
erin
im the one whos injured and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward
erin
boy do i know how you feel first time i heard that number i said you got to be kidding me forty god damn percent
yeah isnt that a shame
mr masry mario gets lost going to the bathroom theyll be driving around the valley for hours
what you think im made of money
and you cant
because they can you heard that kid they have billion dollars at their disposal they can afford to waste all the time in the world
i dont get why theyd do that
that wasnt an offer a million wouldve been an offer when they send the god damn mail clerk down to jerk me off waste my time its a fuck you
at least they made an offer
it sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice
so you think we got em scared
im telling you the minute brenda sent the fax im talking the second she pressed that send button pge claims department is on the phone to me scheduling a meeting
find out
so far but that place is a pig sty i wouldnt be surprised if theres more
this is the only thing you found
a ten percent raise and benefits but thats it im drawing the line
ten theres a lot of other places i could work
okay a raise and
look erin this is not the way i do business this extortion nonsense
i want a raise and benefits including dental
lemme see it will you
course i did
that document you found the one that says it was the bad chromium you didnt happen to make a copy did you
boy you musta really finetoothcombed it then huh and uyouu fired umeu jesus
i didnt see any medical records in there
the ones in the box of files the box of files the one from your office
what medical records
it doesnt take a genius to look at those medical records and think somethings wrong
so what made you think it was
they told her something but it cant have been too specific cause i talked to her and she sure didnt think her water was bad
but pge told her about the chromium
you wanna know you gotta hire me back i got a lot of bills to pay
so whats the story on this thing this cancer stuff
boy are you ever a shitty judge of people
i dont know maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun
now why in the hell would you assume that
look im sorry you were gone i just assumed you were off having fun
well that was nice of him isnt it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give em the ax
he wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium is parts per million and that at the rate you mentioned it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about the irvings
oh yeah
i got an interesting call this afternoon it was from a dr frankel
what are you doing here
bullshit youre trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed fuck if ill help you do that
come on im trying to help here
dont bother
okay enough now look erin this incident aside i dont think this is the right place for you so what im gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf find you something else okay
thats not how we work here you dont just leave a message and take off
i left a message ive been dealing with that real estate thing i was gonna write up a whole damn report and
erin youve been gone for a week
i guess im not the right kind
how come youre not at lunch with the girls youre a girl

oh okay thats okay
janes the office manager she handles payroll and petty cash but she leaves early on fridays
i was wondering could you tell me who id talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck just for the weekend
yeah
im unotu everyone else mr masry im someone you made promises to that you didnt deliver on i trusted you with my kids wellbeing now im smart and im hard working and ill do anything but if you think im leaving here without a job you got another thing coming
okay look if you really want to apply for a job here you can do it the way everyone else does send in a rsum make an
i dont need pity i need a paycheck and ive looked but when youve spent the last six years raising babies its real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn so i figure since youre the one who said i was gonna be okay you should be the one to hire me
im sorry about that really but
you said things would be fine and theyre not
i never lied i may have miscalculated that happens sometimes but
theres two things i cant stand mr masry being ignored and being lied to you did both
you did wow sorry about that listen marios a little not so bright he seems to think that you said
you never called me back i left messages
yeah well fuck you sorry doesnt feed my kids

uh huhone point seven and what do you project for this year
we did one point seven million in total revenue

cmon jack you think there arent mornings when i wake up and wonder what the hell im doing in new jersey

nowi dont
and now
i never used to be like this kate i had it all figured out no doubts no regrets
no well maybe a few things but mostly just different
worse you mean
i used to be so sure about everything you know i knew exactly who i was and what i wanted then one morning i woke up and suddenly it was all different
are you sure

oh stop things will change my aunt mary always said theres a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class
i tell you something anne i really feel like im cursed
oh i got a pimple this stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color like it really works ya know
you have a little uh something on your face
oh sure gotta believe in god but i dont think god made man in his own image no cause most of the bullshit that happens is because of men no i think man was made out of the devils image and women were created out of god because women can have babies which is sorta like creating and which also explains why women are attracted to men because lets face it the devil is a helluva lot more interesting i slept with a few saints and let me tell you ubooooorringu and so the whole point of life i think is for men and women to get married so the devil and god can live together and ya know work it out not that we have to get married
you still believe in god
oh i used to be such a catholic
okay i love you
im not seeing anyone else i really was attacked
please before you go on let me tawk okay weve had a wonderful time together when we first met you said this wasnt serious and i shouldnt get serious and then you moved in and we havent been serious and i just wanna say that i have no regrets none and dont wanna have any now so i want ya to be up front with me i want the truth if youre seein somebody else let me know you dont have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me just tell me the truth
i i stayed at a friends listen i
so where did you sleep last night

im sorry
yeah well suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes
it happens to be a beautiful love story ya know you used to like that about me you used to say you liked that i didnt make you think so much that we could be together and not think
because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how america doesnt know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny tv celebrity because that would just mean that im not really talented
then why the hell do we watch all the time
its not funny its sophomoric and mindless and dumb
well its funny whatta want from me
why dont you go upstairs take the day off all rightill cook tonight

what if i was a relative
well its not unusual in his case sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brains replay system the brain never loses anything it just stores it up and waits a person could actually reexperience the full effect of a tragedy long after the event took place are you relatives well it doesnt matter well take care of it hell have to be sent back to the same institution
buthow could that happen
im afraid not then again im not sure the beatings bad but its not the problem it seems hes reexperiencing the catatonia so like before he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years i dont know theres no way to tell
yeah so the guys beat up hehe probably has a concussion or something right hell snap out of it
he cant hear you hiim dr weintraub i was on duty when they brought him inive been going over his record he was brought in once before i understand catatonic stuporcondition rendered him nonverbal for a period of

maybe when we get the grail
parry you dont have to uearnu a woman its the twentieth century
i cant ask for heri have to earn her
then lets begin with the story itself its a story of the grail mythand although there are several variations my favorite begins with the fisher king as a young boy who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage and during that night he is visited by a sacred vision out of the fire appears the holy grail gods highest symbol of divine grace and a voice says to the boy you shall be the guardian of the grail that it may heal the hearts of menbut the boy was overcome innocent and foolish he was blinded by greater visions a life ahead filled with beauty and glory hope and powertears filled his eyes as he sensed his own invincibility a boys tears of naive wonder and inspiration and in this state ofradical amazementhe felt for a brief moment not like a boy but like god and so he reached into the fire to take the grail and the grail vanished and the boy hands were left caught in the flamesleaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him when he became king he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the grail but with each year that passed with each campaign he fought the grail remained lost and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse he became a bitter man life for him lost its reason with each disappointment with each betrayal with each loss this wound would grow soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starveduntil finally the king lost all faith in gods existance and in mans valuehe lost his ability to love or be loved and he was so sick with experience that he started to die as the years went on his bravest knights would search for the grail that would heal their king and make them the most respected and valued men in the land but to no avail pretty soon finding the grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the kings power which only confirmed the kings worst suspicions of man causing his wound to grow his only hope he thought was death then one day a fool was brought in to the king to cheer him he was a simpleminded man not particularly skilledor admired he tells the king some jokessing him some songs but the king feels even worsefinally the fool says what is it that hurts you so much how can i helpand the king says i need a sip of water to cool my throatso the fool takes a cup from the bedstand fills it with water and hands it to the kingsuddenly the king feels a lot better and when he looks to his hands he sees that it was the holy grail the fool handed himan ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all alongand the king asks how can this behow could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find and the fool answers i dont know i only knew you were thirsty and for the first time since he was a boy the king felt more than a man not because he was touched by gods glorybut rather by the compassion of a fool

theyll recognize me
where is your head jerome youre acting like a guilty man they wont marry the eyelash to you they wont believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years
you dont understand theyll make the connection theyll hoover again we should cut our losses
im not going anywhere less than a week to go not on your life

oh i see you got your individual slices of hope dignity confidence selflove justice and harmony
other people cant
i have no illusions about the future what is is we make choices and we become the sum total of our choices i can live with that
you kill people
thats because i speak human and you speak monster
you dont understand
you dont get to have me you are a monster im a human being were not going to mate
ill hide
what if i come back
im staying here
will you come with me
thats probably a good idea
i was leaving
you never could have kept this from me
a sociopath kills for no reason i kill for money
let me help you along martin youre a sociopath
like that theres a point an organic connection between all living things
okay great martin thats just great meaning to life mmm
then i started losing my taste for it which usually means your time is up but then i realized it was something entirely different i started getting the sneaking dark suspicion that maybe there was meaning to life
jesus christ
i was but no yes i was before but now im not its irrelevant really the idea of governments nations its mostly a public relations theory at this point anyway but ill tell you something until about five months ago i really enjoyed my work
youre a government spook
seriously when i left i joined the army and took the service exam they found my psych results fit a certain profile a certain moral flexibility would be the best way to describe it i was loaned out to a cia sponsored program its called mechanical operations we sort of found each other
get the fuck outta here
about five years now
its something i do
is it something youve done
no
not the other way around
yes
he was trying to kill you right
could be the physical substance of love
like love
too junkykitschy deeper deeper
like heroin
even though i left you never left me not just memory but a substance in my blood
okay then clearly candied diller
no time
wow i have to give this some thought
its just a game alright candied diller or wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth
shes not dead
soft ill take the junkie otter clearly id let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants okay would you rather make love to the candied corpse of phyllis diller
okay would you rather commit yourself sexually to a fourbynine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a supermodel for a month or make love to a otter on crank for a week
which would you rather
we havent seen each other since high school
yes actually we just bought that little frank lloyd wright on pine avenue debis a social worker and i mow down insurance claims at aetna
what
shoulda brought my gun
right
i think theyll probably have booze there
do you want to get a drink first
ill just help myself to a cocktail
let me get my coat
okay hold on
you look beautiful
here let me put these in some rubbing alcohol
as long as i get the laugh
flowers thats funny
dont rush to judgement until all the facts are in
youre fucking psycho
this night this reunion will be an important step in our relationship
hello
pick me up at my fathers house at around seven and dont be late this time
yes
are you there
ill think about it
seven it is
unbelievable
yes
let me get this straight are you asking me out
i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven oclock
thatd be good
its a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever
whats that
jesus marty youre pathetic it sounds like you need a shockabuku
bad television
watched television
bad people
you met people
bad experiences
im sure youve done worthwhile things in the last ten years youve had experiences
well theres not much to tell
okay lets catch up you go first
yep
its always the little things
well youll have a ball you seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back the car the suit the watch the look that just leaves the little things like happiness character point of view
thats part of it
no im not going is that why youre here
are you going to the reunion
uh no so youre back now a decade later and you want to sort things out with me the question now is do i allow you access to my being
you see someone
ohhh youre in therapy too marty
and i guess sure seeing you would be part of that whole equation i suppose the most important thing really i dont know anyway this whole things my therapists idea its my shrink really
torn down in the name of convenience
i dont know exactly i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization i thought you know maybe seeing you some friends my house of course now a
more like what happened what happened mr blank
where have i been
all right mystery man i want some answers lets recap spring of two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry the girl sits in a sevenhundred dollar prom dress at her fathers house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life the boy never shows up until now so whats the question
okay
well i gotta go but ill come back
professional killer do you get dental with that
im a professional killer
whats your business
not much else
thats it
im in california most of the time traveling a lot on business thats about it really
tell me about yourself
here is now there there is here
well let me see they tore down the george orwell monument and put up a bust of george michael main streets a fourlaner no left turns four to seven i was married and divorced and grosse pointe is now officially the new sister city to lower hutt new zealand we have fiberoptic town meetings every two months
ten years i think what i miss
since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word
how long has it been
its nice to see you again
i just play my own collection
this is me breating
take a deep breath and realize that this is me breathing
i am at home with the me i am rooted in me who is on this adventure
out loud
okay repeat this after me
saw my mom im with debi and im on my way to the reunion
what else say more
if i get antsy ill kill a few small animals
go to your reunion martin see those people and discover what they mean to you try not to kill anybody for a few days see how you feel
morality
what stuff
if i show up at your door chances are you did something to bring me there i dont care about that stuff anyway
maybe some of the discomfort youre feeling is guilt remorse over the innocent people youve killed
anyway that never use to happen i was always the prodigy now im just one of the guys
uneasy dispassionate bored its just getting hard to go to work in a good mood im starting to think ive been in the business too long last week i did a guy younger than me
and how have you been feeling about your work lately
mmm
yes
so youre saying that ulysses everything he said to his queen when he came backeverything was a lie he just wanted to fuck around
i think what you fear martin is domesticity its the greatest fear that men have who belong to western culture its centuries old like king phillip in the th or th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought well wouldnt it be great if we hit the road and fought oh the saracens so he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families
were both professionals oatman
you know where i live
why not i trust you you couldnt turn me in because of doctorpatient privilege and i dont want to be withholding and i know where you live
you neednt be so frank with me about your work
theyll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do what am i going to say i killed the president of paraguay with a fork
say more
i just know
how do you know
tell me about your vision of the reunion
shouldnt you be taking notes
weve spent a lot of time discussing those years remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared to the thought of the thing thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite
come on
you went to school with these people
its in michigan honestly what do i have in common with those people or with anyone
why dont you want to go to your high school reunion
and when you think of it its not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world is it
up on the right
i am part of a network of minds a group of five people who are all connected over hundreds even thousands of miles through the mind we can think with each other think for each other i can be driving somewhere sleeping with a woman whatever it is and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone elses mind far away running someone elses brain
because your problem is youre bored and you have a very big mind i am part of what i call a brain syndicate
okay
i been looking at you and ive decided that i want to share something with you
its only natural
sometimes i am sometimes its only natural
well lets just say that sometimes im right sometimes you are
no
you look like youre far away far away and thinking about other things im right about that arent i
i do some guys cant adjust to it they cant handle it
you understand the psychology of the job
thats it then thats it ive always been alone thats why im a good driver i can handle it see i can think on my feet i survive im a thinker and i can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it dont bother me some people cant do it some people are ranting and raving tell them fuckin people to get out here and get in this car i cant i want a go where you gonna go youre gonna wind up back in your garage at seven oclock at night you aint going nowhere you leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening whats the big deal right
i work alone
do you like the people you work with
effective but to tell you the truth ive lost my passion for work
how was your day today sir
excellent here they come
there you go i left it blank
okay
how about i sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece
dont listen to him hes a professional
i know what i do isnt moral per se but if you could just look past that youd see a man worth loving
its okay its martin the door begins to open revealing debi and newberry
nice talk sugarmouth
yeah after i shoot you through the fucking forehead im gonna fuck you in the bullethole
is that right
fine but were not going to let you do your job because were gonna do it and then after we do your job were gonna do another little job
no deal
i didnt get into this business to have associates and i dont want to join your goddamned union loner loner gunman get it on my own thats the whole point why dont you become a cop or something you can drink coffee in the morning with friends
but since were both here i think its time to take a fresh look at our relationship
hard to get good help these days
i told them to kill you and they didnt
a little misunderstanding among my associates
no harm no foul
come on live a little im sorry about the incident yesterday
wholegrain pancakes and an egg white omelette
i want two eggs poached hash brown welldone english muffin for the bread and a coffee
im gonna get you kid
not me so dont paw at me with your dirty little guild
its a freemarket evolution youll wake up to it cmon kid we used to run together when you were a rookie i dont want to run against you this things real everybodys in
and you could be sort of like a father figure to me
we could be working together making big money killing important people im willing to let you in on the ground floor
thank you no
like a club work less make more
like a union
im setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts
what do you want
i guess
the more things change the more they goddamned well stay the same
nope
have you seen debi newberry
here take my card wait a minute heres a special one for topshelf clients
well i have to take this over to debi
those all seem kind of related
sometimes im in divorce mainly some property some personal injury
that sounds pretty interesting
im an attorney im with moss brice fromeyer
hey bob
hello bob
not bad you
hello martin how have you been
hey ken how have you been
good for a second there i thought we were in trouble
no
did you see blank in there
i get it
if he does our job hes our job
looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us
i love i kill
one cannot love and kill
youre wrong look at his face
he using her
hes falling for her look at him
yup
so if we do his job were the bad guys if we do our job were the good guys
look you want to kill a good guy but not be a bad guy you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy and then you come in and kill the bad guy and then youre the good guy
wait a minute
do his job im not a coldblooded killer
why dont we just do his job then so we can do our job and get the fuck out of here
we cant do our job unless he does his job
i wish hed do his job already so we could do our job
whatever
it was the plo
thats strictly badermeinhof stuff
yes and the munich olympics in a local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened

wow
well they were hiring and it was only a two week course
how did you get this job
to shoot you correct
so its not a meaningful symbol or anything that badge is just the badge of your company if i look suspicious on your customers property well under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to ah to shoot me
well a course taxes provide your basic service police and whatnot but our customers need a little more than just that you understand this badge doesnt mean that i am a peace officer
so when are you authorized to use deadly force
thats good
im a professional killer
so what are you doing with your life now son
why not
oh you know me martin im the same old sellout babyboomer exploiting the oppressed i got shot for at kent state but why dont we have a drink and forget the whole thing
i took the other road im more of a selfreflective young lion who does business with leadpipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milkyeyes isolation i love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone and you
i visualized you in a haze as one of the slackster flannelwearing coffeehousemisanthropes ive been seeing in newsweek
hows that
martin i dont know where youve been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago and i dont care it was good that you left and im glad you did so what do you want to talk about youve grown up a bit maybe i had you figured wrong
how are you hows business
good evening mr blank
good evening mr newberry

the point was to love each other

why
i dont know any other way annie
how thoughtful of you and what if i decide not to go
i figured whenever you decided to go youd be all set
i cant do this i cant leave you
two people cant just be alone together in the world at least not us

just make yourself comfortable
not really id forgotten how long its been since ive done this and i couldnt get any parmesan cheese
everything under control
how did you find out all that
yeah i think it is and i dont mean everybodys got to be married have kids its more like knowing where youre from where you belong what feeds you where you can go no matter what happens knowing what youre supposed to be doing while youre here
thats very important to you isnt it home
i hear that see i knew she was never going to be a ranchest but i wanted to try i thought maybe shed give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school maybe even recitals my son would grow up here maybe have one or two more id teach em what i could theyd play with my brothers kids all grow up together and even if they all decided to go out into the world theyd always know where home was cause wed keep it for em
we did at one point when we thought wed have more children and we after tried we tried everything but wasnt meant to be
ever think of moving there full time
it is its lovely
grace told me you have a country house in connecticut sounds like a beautiful place
she was never really happy here she did the best she could
why didnt it work out
college in illinois she was playing the cello i hadnt heard cello music growing up she had the reddest hair the bluest eyes when she played it was
how did you meet her
yeah i havent seen him in a while he used to come to the ranch over summers but then he started having friends and was going off to college so good boy hal lives in new york near his mom

hed be grateful hed take real good care with you
poor thing
you havent heard the question yet truth is youd be doing me a favor i got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old rimrock here is feeling kind of left out

enjoy the day
just polite well maybe youd like to try riding again some time before you go home
are you shy mr booker
she did
why dont you ride anymore grace told me you used to ride when she was younger
hes beautiful
oh yes i forgot
its all right hes young just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you
i have a way with animals
i thought you were an editor not a reporter
i thought you lived in chicago
sorry about that i thought everything got cleared out rb is my wife exwife rachel we used to live in that house together
i found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts
i dont sleep all right anywhere but the house is fine
you sleeping all right in that house
if i can survive rush hour i figure i can handle grizzlies
lucky for you the grizzlies around here only go for joggers
i dont jog mr booker i run
a jogger huh
ive decided its impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat
just whos been laughing at who here
well i uh you didnt
i once heard itzhak perlman guest star with the chicago symphony orchestra he played rachmaninovs vocalize opus no it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music i ever heard i actually forgot where i was for a time you seem surprised
you were married to a woman in chicago
when i was first married
you lived in chicago
does chicago count
ha if youve never lived in a city with museums theater music restaurants uh god a million things then its something i cant explain
whats that to miss
well its beautiful country ill give you that and i could see having some kind of vacation place retreat but i dont know how you do it full time dont you miss the rest of the world
well maybe i am laughing a bit i just thought as long as youre here it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little
its a mans world mr booker most women have to
oh i see you write both sides of the conversation
thats your cue to say youre not laughing at me
you stand still too long in new york you get hit by a bicycle messenger you know sometimes i get the feeling mr booker that youre laughing at me why is that
you ever just stand still for a minute
what
dont be so sure its my last there are a few people back home id like to put under a red hot iron
so how was your first and last day of branding
it is cocktail hour yet
you okay
branding i havent branded in years
you know were branding here tomorrow if you two want to come by to watch or give a hand youre welcome
thats up to pilgrim
well its worth it really i mean how much longer do you think you need to work with pilgrim
i dont have a problem with that its up to annie
excuse me with all due respect but this is her decision not yours and i dont want to waste anybodys time mostly mine
look ill talk to grace and call you later
you can make it as complicated or as easy as you like but shes the one whos gonna be riding him am i right so heres the deal im not sure i can do anything but im prepared to give it a go if youll help you have a problem with that
well thatll be a little complicated
when i work with a horse its no good just me doing it it doesnt work that way the owner needs to be involved too
grace grace you want to come with us take a look at pilgrim
doesnt matter
you want us to come with you i just have to run to the main house and give mr peterson a check
uh no i was gonna take a look now
look please dont do the shucks maam thing again ive driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time ive brought him here to your neck of the mountains just take a look at him if you still feel the same way ill be on the road by morning and youll never see me again ok deal
i uh ha ha i dont think i ever met a lady quite like yourself and i appreciate all the pains youve gone through to
all by yourself
well yes i had a trailer its not like i made him run along side of the car
you mean you hauled him all the way out here just like that
oh no shes here i brought him along and my daughter too were staying at petersons
were you thinking of personally driving me back east
well ok here it is uh id like you to take a look at my horse now it wont take long and if after that you still dont feel
plenty of signs just none of them printed who do i get the idea youre not just passing through
its uh beautiful country i had a little bit of a hard time finding the place there are no signs
i am very sorry maam goodbye now
mr booker if i could just ex
i i dont mean to sound insensitive i understand your situation but theres nothing i can do you just called the wrong person thats all i hear there are a bunch of therapists in new york maybe you should call one of them
maam first class to montana is a waste of good money now am i being too polite here or when i say no in utah does that mean yes in new york city
ill pay you for your fare ill send you to montana first class
look even if it was nearer thats just not what i do i give clinics and im not even doing them for a while im heading back to montana right now i got a ranch to take care of
well if you could just come for the day new yorks only a few hours by plane id have you home by dinner
maam im very sorry about your problems and i appreciate what your daughter must be going through but im afraid youve misunderstood whatever it is you read i dont do that sort of thing
well you know however you want to put it i got your information from the publisher of the article i called montana and your sisterinlaw i think gave me this number im been hot on your trail you could say because i was hoping youd consider coming to new york and taking a look at my daughters horse and possibly
well see truth is maam i help horses with peoples problems
i went on the internet and found this article about you it says youre a horse whisperer that you you help people with horse problems and you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized
yeah hello this is tom booker i got a message you called
this is annie maclean
i dont know lets just go and well see

tubab means white man
what do you mean
no i am a tubab
hi um there doesnt seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for tubab who might to have a place for me to stay are you tubab
yes
and i have two choices i can either fight the way things are or accept them see i always knew i loved you more didnt bother me i always felt lucky a little amazed that such a vibrant beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me and i guess i thought as long as i did everything right if i was the best husband i could be the best father even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us if i could do all that it wouldnt make any difference if we loved each other the same or not i wasnt asking for more i told myself i didnt need more but you dont know how you feel about me you dont know if you want a life with me anymore and i dont want you to come home until you do know one way or the other
i dont understa
ill tell you something annie i stood there looking at what was happening to that horse and i swear it felt like the same thing was happening to me
what do you mean
take your time
yeah what
may i have a suggestion
probably first thing in the morning its too late to start now im going to try not to do too much driving in the dark
connecticut i told the office id work out of there next week when are you planning to start back
are you going to stay in the city or go up to connecticut
lets not talk about that now
how are you feeling about work
no its okay believe me there were plenty of times i didnt know what the hell was right
you were right about coming here im sorry for not thinking
i can see why you put your faith in him hes a genuine good guy good at what he does thats rare
you dont have to explain you have every right to come
i apologize for the surprise but the days only opened yesterday and i figured
youre allergic to hay
small bed maybe i should sleep in the barn
honey i hope youre not endangering your position listen if you need to come back and you want me to come take over for a while ill work it out i mean the firms got other lawyers but the magazines got only one of you
oh i didnt look at my faxes today we left before sunrise
apparently gottschalks been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors lucy said she tried to call you but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon
about what
well uh the real reason i called actually was to tell you i saw lucy at jojos tonight and she seems very worried
i wish i did
fine actually today was a good day you should have seen her
huhhuh you
everything all right
oh well branding will do that to you
oh robert im sorry we were so tired from the branding grace barely made it to her bed and i didnt have the energy to take my clothes off

well its good that youre there
taking forever i just got an additional list of sixtytwo employees to interview before monday i dont know how im going to do it
yeah she seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch which is why i said yes to this move but whenever its just the two of us i dont know anyway whats happening with the delco lawsuit
no thats not what i said im not a dictator if you feel you should come then come just do whatever you think is right
and you think its best if i dont come
she will if you think she should
what if she doesnt want to go
robert were losing her were losing her i dont care what the doctors say the truth is they dont know anymore than we do less when it comes to grace this may not sound sensible or logical but nobodys suggesting anything better i cant explain it robert i just have this feeling this annoying bloody feeling that if if somehow pilgrim can be made all right then so can grace i just know it
i really wish i could understand why you think this is so necessary
im not pretending anything
i dont care what he says we have to do something robert i cant sit here and trust everythings going to work out just by pretending it will
are you a psychiatrist he said it takes time
i cant say hes been all that effective with her
her psychiatrist said she needs security now stability
why
no its uh no i really dont think its a good idea
im in charge i went back very soon after the accident they didnt expect me for a couple of months ill just take that time now i can still oversee things from montana take my fax my computer
what bo what about the magazine

about us going someplace warm someplace gracell have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses
what was i saying
no
what did he say
yeah
did you get a hold of that horse guy
theyre still our friends annie its nothing serious you kid about them all the time and i could tell paul really appreciated me being there
why did you go
all our favorite people were there saying all their favorite things about their favorite subjects i thought to myself weve been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody were so afraid we wont like each other and have nobody go to dinners with
how was the dinner
helping all the time running to her every time she trips or falls anticipating her all the time
doing what
youve got to stop doing that
do you do you really
i love you
aw thats so sweet
i had to excuse myself from a meeting its ridiculous i kept thinking about the baby you and i swear i was going to start bawling right into my briefs
you can hardly get your arms around me how depressing youre so early
hows my pregnant chick
sing it to me frankie
fresh wind in her hair life without care shes broke but its ok

i dont know well figure it out
thats okay we have to talk about it and were not always in the same place so i just have to get used to it what do you want to do about dinner
im sorry about last night i shouldnt have brought it up over the phone
riding with judith
sure whats grace up to
okay you want me to pick you up
i should be in by two
so what uh what train are you taking
hi
hi
its me
no thanks
i have some brownies left over want one
aint brain surgery
diane takes care of the books i dont know how but at the end of every month everything adds up to the penny
ha
well thats just what we need on a cattle ranch a vegetarian from new york
i believe so saw it on a television show once
what they aint going forty miles into choteau everytime they want a hamburger
i dont believe theyll expect that
he thought it was a ghost
we thought we lost him in the snow storm told the kids had a funeral for the damn thing finally snow stops staring to warm up i go out and start cleaning the truck goddamn if that dog doesnt jump out from the back seat covered in snow i nearly stained myself
i dont think warren would go for that
itd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month
and next time miss annie you can run down the calves
well id like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding
our daddy raised pure herefords
they dont get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow and theyre good mother
we should be fine then
bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle
yeah
tom
you know her
i dont believe it
grace listen youve got to do this just trust me one more time
no
hes not hurt hes okay look at him
no youre only going to hurt him some more
grace i need you to come with me
i want to watch
its more or less how it sounds sometimes its not pretty to watch some horses fight it real hard your fellas already shown us he likes a good fight so if you dont want to watch ill call you when its done
what does that mean
theres still something going on inside of him i cant reach so me and smokey here were going to try laying him down okay
sure
sure
theres no hurry take you time
i cant not yet
i know you do dont you disappear you do whatever you have to to hold on ill tell you one more thing when pilgrim reared up to face that truck you know what i think i think that damn horse loved you so much he was trying to protect you thats what i think
i know where he goes
i wont tell you itll stop feeling this bad but i can tell you you didnt do anything wrong the same thing would have happened to me or frank or joe and theres no sense in looking for a reason why things happen i used to try and always came up short i dont think the why sos important as what we do with what we get i remember this boy id see up on the blackfeet reservation he was sixteen great kid strong hed gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock snapped his neck paralyzed him after the accident id look in on him from time to time and he wasnt there anymore his mind his spirit whatever you want to call it it just disappeared and what was left was nothing but anger its like the boy i knew just went away somewhere
getting old not being of much use i guess what went on out there grace with pilgrim
are you afraid of anything
that must have been pretty special
we bought him in kentucky my mother and i took a trip down there to see him
where did you get pilgrim from
not a question of if you can you are just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself
i dont know if i can

norville im sorry i i tried to tell you so many times its hard to admit when youve been wrong if you could just find it in your heart to to give me another chance
barman setm up fella
oh norville i
oh its you lookin for a nitwit to buy your lunch
huh
norville
you son of a
consider this my resignation
now amy
worked in a watch factory
shutup after all you havent talked to me for a week and now im going to say my piece ive got a prediction for you norville barnes i predict that since youve decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad youre going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you youre going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that wouldnt give you the time of day if you if you
now aim
shutup but then i figured out you were a swell guy a little slow maybe but a swell guy well maybe youre not so slow but youre not so swell either and it looks like youre an imbecile after
now aim
shutup and dont think i havent noticed how youve changed i used to think you were a swell guy well to be honest i thought you were an imbecile
now aim
ive been watching you norville barnes even though youve been trying to avoid me
youre awful kind to yourself norville barnes the fact is youve slowed down sitting up here like a sultan not doing a lick of work why you know its ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you havent come up with one since the hoop and the reasons plain to see youve forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it wasnt for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here
we have to be realistic amy you know things have slowed down a little here at hudsucker
your i
know about it you think the board would do anything like this without my authorization no this was my idea from the start
you mean you know about this
well yes were pruning away some of the dead wood but if
theyre going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker why in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work people with wives and children and families
well i wouldnt call them nincom
you know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing
never mind about that
oh hello amy was it i thought she said mamie
for petes sake norville
sure norville sure
kiss me once amy kiss me once for luck
oh norville
thats it a great wheel that gives us each what we deserve
yeah i think ive heard of that what goes around comes around
well can i at least call you deer hahahahaha seriously amy the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call karma the great circle of life death and rebirth
i wish it were that simple norville i wish i was still a gazelle and you were an antelope or an ibex
that kind of person would come back as a wildebeest or a warthog no i think it more likely that you were a gazelle with long graceful legs gamboling through the underbrush perhaps we met once a chance encounter in a forest glade i must have been an antelope or an ibex what times we must have had foraging together for sustenance picking the grubs and burrs from one anothers coats or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways
norville there really is something i have to tell you
oh no amy pardon me for saying so but i find that very farfetched
oh i dont know maybe i was just a fasttalking career gal who thought she was one of the boys
what do you think you were in your previous life amy
what a beautiful thought
well the hindus say and the beatniks also that in the next life some of us will come back as ants some will be butterflies others will be elephants or creatures of the sea
the people look like ants
well this year if its good i plan to make it a tradition uh my it certainly is beautiful
every year
yes you can get carrot juice or italian coffee and the people there well none of them quite fit in youd love it why dont you come there with me theyre having a marathon poetry reading on new years eve i go every year
you dont say
uh yes seventeen yes i well no i i never really theres a place i go now the cutest little place near my apartment in greenwich village its called anns its a beatnik bar
no in vidalia farm route
oh yes in muncie
you know on farm route
huh
didja ever go to the top of old man larsons feed tower and look out over the town
certain people are
norville you cant trust people here like you did in muncie
oh i dont blame them really i guess i have sort of made a mess of things these folks have to protect their investment most of them are very nice people
i believe in you norville at least i believe in your intentions
i understand that youre not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts im not that skilled as president oh sure i put up a big front not that everyones buying it
you do
i know that amy
norville theres something i have to tell you you see im not really a secretary
oh it isnt your fault amy youre the one person whos been standing by me through all this
im sorry
thanks people seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story
let me hold it or youll have a real shiner
sid found me the icepack
let me look
oh nothing really just the more timid investors are no longer running for cover
what happened
i bet thats exactly what she tells herself but you and i both know shes just a driedup bitter old maid say how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work i was thinking maybe the king and i
maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance
exactly and i bet shes ugly real ugly otherwise why wouldnt they print her picture next to her byline
smitty
yeah you know probably dresses in mens clothing swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or
oh is that it
yeah you know suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays seems pretty obvious doesnt it shes probably very unattractive and bitter about it
im quite sure i dont know what you mean
yeah you know probably one of these fasttalking career gals thinks shes one of the boys probably is one of the boys if you know what i mean
confused
well its done now whats the use of grousing about it forget the letter amy i just had to blow off some steam
sure but she could still have gotten your side for the record
well she probably had a deadline
well i dont know maybe she does deserve it maybe she shouldve come in to face you man to man
aww naw amy that wont be necessary i shouldnt send it shes just doing her job i guess
why dont i just type this up
you know for kids
oh sure youre biased youre a fellow muncian but would an imbecile come up with this
well i
go on tell the truth i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion
im sure i
well you know me amy at least better than that that dame does do you think im an imbecile
is that all mr barnes
these preposterous inventions would be better suited to the pages of amazing tales magazine if the editors of the manhattan argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter but i doubt it i most seriously doubt it as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales a periodical which i have enjoyed for many years yours sincerely et cetera
or lack thereof
the picture was fine its what that knuckleheaded dame wrote underneath of all the irresponsible amy take this down dear miss archer i call you miss because you seem to have missed the boat completely on this one how on earth would you know whether im an imbecile when you dont even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man no change guts to courage no make it common decency these wild speculations about my intelligence
well i didnt bother to read the article i didnt think the picture did you justice
did you happen to see the front page of todays manhattan argus
please norville
well i just dont know how to thank you mr barnes
a muncie girl can you beat that
of course i went to the muncie uh secretarial polytechnic
oh of all the foolish listen do you take shorthand are you familiar with the mimeograph machine
dont bother to thank me its the easiest thing in the world matter of fact i know where a vacancy just came up
oh no really i
a muncie girl talk about the cats pyjamas tell you what amy im gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the hud
why yes do you know it
youre from muncie
mind if i join you
these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town youve probably never heard of
no thank you seek and ye shall find work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education the ethics of my tender years
cigarette
i myself
a little naive perhaps but thank you armed with determination a solid work ethic and an indomitable belief in the future
at any rate i arrived in town not ten days ago full of dreams and aspirations anxious to make my way in the world

but sid let me urge you to work closely with the new president and to keep giving hudsucker industries all your energies but not your soul for while we must strive for success we must not worship it long live the hud waring hudsucker
yeah go ahead
tough titty toenails
and so sid the future does not belong to such as i nor even you we have made our compromises with time the future belongs to the young who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption accordingly in the spirit of hope and the ringing in of the new i hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company and my seat on the board to whomever is hudsuckers most recent employee at the time of my demise i know this will disappoint you you sid who have served so diligently and for so long but
many years uh i know that you will be wondering why i have decided to move on ending my tenure at hudsucker and here on earth you will be thinking why now when things are going so well granted from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials sure sure were doing fine however sid these things have long since ceased to give me pleasure i look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company now i see only an empty shell whom others call a success how has this come to pass when and why did i trade all of my hopes dreams and aspirations for the emptiness of power and wealth what the heck have i done
yeah yeah its the standard resignation boilerplate go down to the second paragraph
from the desk of waring hudsucker to sidney j mussburger regarding my demise dear sid by the time you read this i will have joined the organization upstairs an exciting new beginning i will retain fond memories of the many years you and i
yes sir
yeah go ahead might learn somethin
sir
well why dont ya read it
yessir
ah its new years im not gonna add to your woes im just saying
geez i
failure to deliver a blue letter is grounds for dismissal
oh geez
its sittin in your apron pocket right where you left it imbecile
huh oh geez mr hudsucker i apologize there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i mustve mislaid
anyway any particular reason you didnt give him my blue letter i mean jesus norman just a dying mans last words and wishes no big deal
yes sir
mm well say what you like about the mans ethics hes a ballsto thewall businessman beat ya any way he can straight for the jugular very effective
norville
jesus christopher that smarts where was i oh yeah the board i guess sidneys been puttin the screws to ya huh norman
i dont care if youre president of the company i need that voucher now
but look im president of the company now and i
i need that voucher i told you a week ago it was important
well im not sure where i
barnes where the hell have you been and wheres my voucher
good afternoon to ya this is norville barnes
yeah
thisll only take a moment
you have a charming wife mr muss uh sid
well frankly i
sidney and i are planning a trip to paris and points continental arent we dear
i havent had
im brushing up on my french with the most charming man pierre of fifth avenue do you know him
disappointment jetais destroyee i was in bed for a week positively sick with fury i called in the gardener and said monsieur gonzalez either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee
that must have been quite a disappointment mrs mussburger
so wed gone out to the hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins
ah forget it kid ya dont have to explain to me hes a little person hes nothing like i say ordinarily it would just be a nuisance but it seems well there was a spy in the company
huh he no i hes just maybe i was a little rough on the boy ya see i
its not important in itself some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming youd stolen the idea for the uh the hoop dingus from him
hows that sid
mm ordinarily i wouldnt bother you with it but this is embarrassing kid it seems to concern you directly
ya dont say
sure sure its a tough course well thanks for coming kid i thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed it seems were having some security problems here at the hud
sorry im late sid that back nine at riverdale is really murder
well im for it
congratulations kid youve really outdone yourself reinvented the wheel im going to recommend to the board that we proceed immediately with this uh with the uh that the dingus be massproduced with all deliberate speed of course as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours
so if you think its appropriate id like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch
finally
but theres such an enormous potential profitwise given the demographics baby boom discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class
damnit wheres my car
thank you sid but the reason i mention it is it would require such a small capital investment again youre the expert here
i do remember and i was impressed anyway thats all forgotten now driver
you dont happen to remember the plan i outlined to you the day i set fire to your off uh the day i was promoted
okay sid like i said youre the expert but
relax norville its only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover
lobby we havent got all day

the whole towns gone crazy

holy mackerel
every cent of it and it still was less than we owe
all of it
about an hour ago i had to hand over all our cash
when
how does anything like this ever start all i know is the bank called our loan
all right now what happened how did it start
i just did but they said you left this is a pickle george this is a pickle
why didnt you call me
george
what is this uncle billy a holiday
that way huh
now you just turn this way and go right straight down
old building and loan pal huh
right down here
oh thank you george old boy old boy now look if youll point me in the right direction would you do that george
well how do you do congratulations congratulations what am i doing
well what do you know wife
how do you do
hello
peanut
no no no no anchor chains plane motors and train whistles
uhhuh breakfast is served lunch is served dinner
theres a squall in there thats shapin up into a storm
its important
some other time george
got to see pop uncle billy
avast there captain cook where you headin
five hundred dollars
yes how much is your equity in it
i see ive suddenly become quite important what kind of security would i have george have you got any stocks
they dont have that kind of money mr potter you know that youre the only one in town that can help me
well what about all your other friends
i cant get hold of him hes in europe
not that it makes any difference to me but why did you come to me why dont you go to sam wainwright and ask him for the money
what is it a woman then you know its all over town that youve been giving money to violet bick
no sir no sir i havent
no sir i didnt want the publicity harrys homecoming tomorrow
have you notified the police
yes sir
all right sir
in the meantime ill draw up the papers
id like to do that
sure sure sure you go on home and talk about it to your wife
well mr potter i i i know i ought to jump at the chance but i i just i wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twentyfour hours to think it over
oh confound it man are you afraid of success im offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year starting today is it a deal or isnt it
well what about the building and loan
oh yes george bailey whose ship has just come in providing he has brains enough to climb aboard
would i youre not talking to somebody else around here are you you know this is me you remember me george bailey
you wouldnt mind living in the nicest house in town buying your wife a lot of fine clothes a couple of business trips to new york a year maybe once in a while europe you wouldnt mind that would you george
the envious ones say that george the suckers now i have stated my side very frankly now lets look at your side young man twentyseven twentyeight married making say forty a week
yes well most people say you stole all the rest
you like it ill send you a box
thank you sir quite a cigar mr potter
i know very well what youre talking about youre talking about something you cant get your fingers on and its galling you thats what youre talking about i know well ive said too much i youre the board here you do what you want with this thing just one thing more though this town needs this measly onehorse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter come on uncle billy
im not interested in your book im talking about the building and loan
just a minute just a minute now hold on mr potter youre right when you say my father was no business man i know that why he ever started this cheap pennyante building and loan ill never know but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character because his whole life was why in the twentyfive years since he and uncle billy started this thing he never once thought of himself isnt that right uncle billy he didnt save enough money to send harry to school let alone me but he did help a few people get out of your slums mr potter and whats wrong with that why here youre all businessmen here doesnt it make them better citizens doesnt it make them better customers you you said whatd you say just a minute ago they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home wait wait for what until their children grow up and leave them until theyre so old and brokendown that they do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars just remember this mr potter that this rabble youre talking about they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community well is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath anyway my father didnt think so people were human beings to him but to you a warped frustrated old man theyre cattle well in my book he died a much richer man than youll ever be
you see if you shoot pool with some employee here you can come and borrow money what does that get us a discontented lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class and all because a few starryeyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas now i say
yes sir
theyre not my children
pop
have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages
pop
well now listen i want you to put every cent youve got into our stock you hear and george i may have a job for you that is unless youre still married to that brokendown building and loan this is the biggest thing since radio and im letting you in on the ground floor oh mary mary
money yeah well a little
that so well ill tell him hey that sounds great oh baby i knew youd come through now heres the point mary mary youre in on this too now listen have you got any money
oh i dont know why not right here you remember that old tool and machinery works you tell your father he can get that for a song and all the labor he wants too half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down
well why not can you think of anything better
rochester well why rochester
well dads snapped up the idea hes going to build a factory outside of rochester how do you like that
huh yeahyeahyeah soybeans yeah

denver got very silent about a day ago san diegos got a fever for cush this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft people get crazy and san diego you should know is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty signing bonus of eight million

you could help me find her you know the people ill pay you a hundred dollars
arlyn had a very big habit heroin shes the one who started frank shes strung out now you wont find her
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too
frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his traveltime
did she and jane mckenna know each other
arlyn page

what about the other things youve reported being followed on the
just phone calls right they ring you answer they dont say anything just blank kids getting kicks burglars looking for an empty apartment i mean there is nothing that proves
everything thats happened since tom grunemann disappeared the phone calls and the
what about everything since

i cant say he was anybody
but you cant say that dumper was tom grunemann
nothing except he wasnt kidding usually its a fakeout you probably know they pretend to tie you up and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you hell its their money ill hang from the shower rod and whistle maytime except this guy was really tripped out on it he
what what do you remember about that dumper
you remind me of my uncle

mm

mm
youre not police or fbi youre just a private investigator
dew yew hayuv ahdentifikyshun
will you let me ask you some questions
honest
you know what im talking about miss daniel
why
he was a research engineer at the tuscarora laboratories in pennsylvania he disappeared from there last april ive been hired to look for him
gee
tom grunemann he wrote you some letters
who
im an investigator id like to ask you some questions about tom grunemann

tomorrow see you tomorrow night
well
no id like to be in on it
just send me a money order
suppose i meet you there a half hour before
tomorrow evening nine east river drive and rd street
i can talk it over possibly i can get the money when are you meeting the man
all right but im going to see that list
klute the companys interest is tom grunemann solely and exclusively you say you cant find tom all right ill see that youre paid off the case is closed
it probably has the dumpers name it might give us some kind of new lead i want a look at it anyhow
no its ridiculous this has nothing to do with tom grunemann
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckennas list of clients
i cant follow you
im meeting a man tomorrow night he wants to meet me on eastriver drive he wants five hundred dollars for the book can you get that for me pete
you were hired to look for tom
callgirls generally keep a book you know a list of their clients sometimes if a girl retires shell even sell it worth good money jane mckenna had a black book when she died it was stolen ive been after it a long time
what
pete ive got a chance to buy jane mckennas black book
you were hired to look for tom not someone
someones been doing all these things
you said he was no possible connection with tom the page girl told you that not tom
dumper the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew
that who
not too bad this brings back that dumper in the picture
you must be discouraged
no no mistake pete it doesnt prove who it was but proves it wasnt tom
some mistake perhaps that
not tom whoever it was left a kind of souvenir i told you in her clothing semen the laboratory got a blood group reading from that the man was blood type tom was an ab
it has to be tom you said he ripped up his own pictures he
it wasnt tom that broke in the room
im sorry i dont understand
yeah it wasnt tom
you said trask was arranging laboratory work police laboratory anything from that
yeah two things pete that
im on my way to chicago very important meeting tonight well any new developments
yeah
ive been up country you know my summer place my camp i dont even have a telephone there this morning they sent a messenger out that youd been trying to call me
well as a matter of
i read your report i had to go along with it the idea of this being a wild goose chase tom being nowhere around
well theres a couple
sorry we had to meet here but im pressed for time
i think youre homesick ill be out at my camp over the weekend nice right now that touch of fall in the air that skim of frost in the early mornings very peaceful john ill be back here again thursday ill be in touch lieutenant thank you
how is it back there
im flying back out to pennsylvania friday ill fill them in on things
its got to make sense some way
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer not tom you said the dumper was clearly not tom
i could try arlyn page again she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel
where how
i better keep looking
then close the case
its where it doesnt get me ive got nothing left that connects to anything
all right suppose it wasnt tom grunemann where does that get you
i believed her pete
she wouldnt be reliable anyhow a narcotics addict
goodbye pete
thank you goodbye john
all right
all right all right john just sit tight will you ill read your report ill discuss it with the others ill be back next thursday well talk the whole thing over then nothing til thursday all right
i wanted to give it to you first
do they have the report have you discussed it with them
its in the report
have you discussed this with them
no they never did really but thats what im going to recommend the next step unless something
im sure the fbi and the police explored that possibility
i think tom grunemanns dead ive been a lot of places ive asked a lot of people ive found no proof hes around ive found no proof he was ever around
whats in it
would you like to know whats in it the report
its not so bad
its a beautiful day in tuscarora i dont envy you that humidity in the city
ill be sending you on a report tonight
john how are you
would i be telling you all this she copped out long ago she committed suicide baxter
id like to talk with jane mckenna
you dont tell them that one of their own inlaws laid a dumper on them peace in the family beyond that i dont know all she wrote
why didnt you tell bree afterwards
ok and one of them jane mckenna she blows a little jealous of bree you know bree comes first and evidently she knew the freak that he was a dumper she conned me into passing him to bree you know so breed get hurt i didnt know till afterwards
she told me
ok a family matter between the girls i had two other cows two other girls besides bree
look dad i may stand better with the cops than you
they tell me you use narcotics could i bring someone around to look at your arms
two years ago sorry
im looking for a man tom grunemann bree thinks he may have been the dumper that call she had two years ago she says you sent her on it
id like to make something clear i dont go after a girl a girl comes to me her choice right
ive just got a few
ive always respected bree id like to make something clear
oh sure they try the idea of a better life but they dont really know much about life they get confused or scared or frustrated or bored they pop back to the one thing they can handle the trick the trick men in bed not men in general not life not love not even real sex it avoids all that just the trick the transaction
i think shes trying that
no she had every good intention of it coming to me as a private patient getting out of the life devoting herself to an acting career
has she talked with you since prison
about his letters thats all she remembered quite violent material id say obsessive a quite sick man but thats not unusual either
did she talk about him to you
not unusual
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it
usual case history this isnt a medical confidence its all of them broken family lonely confused crummy childhood early promiscuity formal prostitution beginning in her teens income twentyfive to thirty thousand a year oh they dont keep the money they get rid of it they get pimps why why do you want to know all this
he called this morning from tuscarora asked me to meet him at at the downtown heliport hes on his way to chicago
sounds to me you better shake him again put him in a spot he has to do something more but this time give him a time and a place to do it
what about grunemanns letters to the girl everything like that
because he knew i couldnt leave the case alone and this way at least hed keep track of it and me
but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann
examine this letter please we recovered that from the shredder the plant disposal and incinerator system grunemann apparently typed it friday before he left decided not to send it tossed it away weve already contacted the new york police they think they know the girl in question
no
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york
everybodys got some i guess
marital problems in general indicates possibly am i right sergeant
no
did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed indicates no did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here indicates no moral or sexual problems or peculiarities
no
can you account for his disappearance in any way
we grew up together kids
you knew the subject thomas grunemann how well
i know tom grunemann
then how are you involved
town police
are you with plant security sergeant
klute with a k k l u
if we get anything from the lab well have it by noon and just think all he really had to do was write us a letter
nobodys seen that
its damn lucky you didnt have the dossier on cable here
i left them here i was doing some work here
gov want to leave me that one how come he got to play with this one anyway
i dont believe toms alive
we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior but theres no evidence of murder theres not even a body
i never could believe that tom was a split personality i never believed he was a dumper and i dont believe he disappeared of his own volition and i dont believe hes alive
what else do you know
i knew tom never wrote that letter
unless he was involved with grunemanns disappearance
but what reason could he have what possible reason
thought it might its off an arrest report you typed two years ago man you wanted samples of everybody
i dont know it looks familiar to me
think this is our guy
yeah
well
i looked it up
thats how the other one died you know in the water
i believed her the dumper was not tom grunemann
hes right you know waiting for the pusher shed tell you anything
unknown unidentified and unwanted and theres more every day man theres more everyday
thats a lot of people to die unknown
its pathetic you cant be desperately in love when youre years old

they got tired of fighting went to the indian territories for a while but the slaveraiders were on em even there and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to mexico crossed at eagle pass
so they stayed in florida
they teaching that now good only a couple of em held outthis man john horse and his friend wild cat and a fella name of osceola army put all of them in prison and osceola died but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten fifteen years beat zach taylor and a thousand troops at lake okeechobee
the trail of tears
he was part of the seminole nation got pushed down into the everglades in pioneer days african people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them married up had children when the spanish give up florida the usarmy come down to move all them indian peoples off to oklahoma

but buddy deeds was my salvation
your mother was a saint
we made our collection at rodericks place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him he went missing the next day along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail
charley wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him
that buddy was a cool breeze
mas cerveza por favor
and the sheriff at the time was big charley wade charley was one of your oldfashioned bribeorbullets kind of sheriffs he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county
believe
the two of us were the only deputies back then me and buddyits what
hell everybody heard that story a million times
tell that one hollis
thats not the whole story the mexicans that know that remember understand what buddy was for their people hell it was mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him
they just wanted it to be one of theirs
bad enough all the street names are in spanish
king wasnt mexican fenton
every other damn thing in the country is called after martin luther king they cant let our side have one measly park
better late than never korean war hero sheriff for near thirty years buddy deeds memorial p
big day coming upi wish wed have thought of it while he was still living but he went so unexpected
he was a unique individual
sam i was just telling a few about your old man
he known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up old fishbait he says never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it
buddy deeds he had a way
fishbait says buddy in that quiet way of his what you know about them tires that went missing from markets fishbait thinks for a minute then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it cmon out pooter they caught us
when you backed me you needed somebody named deeds to bump the other fella out of office hey folks
when we backed you
we need a drug rehab program we need a new elementary school
dammit sam the people are concerned about crime
were already renting cells to the feds for their overflow
thats a matter of interpretation
we dont need a new jail
which is why we need to talk to you about the new jailjust so were all on the same page
rather have that than the tenfoot high catfish statue
that kind of talk doesnt help sam
jorge and his chamber of commerce boys got to keep things hummin
seems like we have another one every week
historic occasion isnt it
word gets out who that body was people are gonna think buddy done it
dont think the rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have
widows benefits he figured it would make the disappearance look better and that mexican gal was just scrapin by after charley killed her man they didnt get hooked up till late
and the ten thousand
the three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under cant say i was much help
buddy deeds was a murderer
buddy deeds
yeah and my mother was a saint for fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business but hell whats that you got a problem buddyll fix it facing some time in jail buddyll knock half of it off if you do what he says when he says you got some business thats not exactly legal talk to buddy
your father had the finest sense of justice of any man i ever met
imonna find out one way or the other
open late
hey sam
fellas
i got to go see somebody in san antonio today your memory gets any better ill be back tonight
you lived in the mans house what seventeen eighteen years and you didnt get to know him any better than that
i think somewhere between roderick bledsoes club and his house wade ran into buddy deeds i think buddy put a bullet in him waited for him to die threw him in the trunk of the sheriffs car and drove him out by the army post i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back
do you
i got an idea what happened
i wish i could tell you i remembered something new but i cant
charley wade
we have a murder
you thought any more about our murder
sam quite a do the other day it meant a lot to folks that you said something
morning hollis
and i understand why you might want to think he could
people have worked this whole big thing up around my father if its built on a crime they deserve to know now i understand why you might want to believe he couldnt do it
we got that dedication tomorrow this is a hell of a time to be draggin up old business
and buddy was one of them
theres no call for that sam fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years
besides my father i mean
forensics people are sure of it you have any idea who might have put him there
no i think his widows still in their place in darktown though you think its charley wade huh
he still living
he owned the colored roadhouse before big o
bledso
i told the story enough timeshell we were just in the car he was stewing about the fight with buddy while we drove over to roderick bledsoes
you dont remember anything else from that last night you saw him do you
all it was wearing was a big old masonic ring and a rio county sheriffs badge
charley i believe he was used to go for lodge meetings over to laredo whats he got to do with your body
you recall if charley wade was a mason
was it davy crockett or jim bowie
we found a body out by the army base yesterday been there for a long time
just as well the new people just painted it some godawful color
no
you go by your old house
i havent been out here for a while
sounds great where do i sign up

sam hey podner you caught me playing hooky
i always wondered what you mayors do when youre not cutting ribbons
look i know you had some problems with your father and he and muriel well
right
ohhe come to an accommodation money doesnt always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning
not a peep buddy run the man out of town
never heard from him again
she put it even at three to three so as the mayor i get to cast the tiebreaker the older generation wont have any problem with it they remember how buddy come to be sheriff that it was all cause he took their part
that so
right but nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news
santiago
there was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the gulf war ruben
oh you know the usual troublemakers danny padilla from the sentinel that crowd
i heard there was a bit of a fuss
look im not gonna campaign against your deal here but if anybody asks me i got to tell them the truth we dontneeda new jail
there isnt money allocated for that but a jail
it wouldnt happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing would it hl and jorge you wouldnt be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters
there was a mandate in the last election
dannys gonna be out for blood the next time
he agreed it wasnt exactly news
the perdido thing
i got eddie richter at the sentinel to kill that story
you ought to put up a banner frontera texas gateway to cut rate pussy
sam
people come here to catch bass and to get laid at the boys town in cuidad leon

do you remember the last time you saw him
not if they was colored or meskin not if they wanted to keep breathin
people didnt complain
sheriff buddy was a different story long as roderick throw his weight the right way on election day make sure all the colored get out to vote we was called colored back then if you was politemaybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then things was peaceful that sheriff wade though he took an awful big bite
and my father
wasnt legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club see roderick used to say buy yourself a drink you get a free membership but sheriff wade he could shut you down anytime
he squeezed money out of you
them days you deal with sheriff wade or you didnt deal at all first of the month every month he remind you of who you really workin for
you had to deal with him in running the club
not if i can help it
so you must remember sheriff wade
we run that twentyodd years give it over to otis payne in april
he had the club out on the old trail road
i wont say nothing bad about the man but you can ask away
you mind if i ask a few questions about your husband roderick

buddy was more a part of the big picturecounty political machine chamber of commerce zoning board if i kept those people happy he was pretty much on my side whenever somebody thoughtthey start up another bar for the black folks theyd behow should i put this theyd be officially discouraged
what was your deal with him

and when my father was sheriff
could of been that was white peoples business
that was the night he disappeared
ohi think he came in one more time with hollis andnaw your daddy wasnt with them made their monthly pickup roderick wasnt in so i just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope
and that was the last time you saw him
i didnt understand the spot i was putting roderick in
chucho montoya saw it with his own eyes shot him in cold blood

ive heard wade was a bit tough on the mexicans

but its great being with them after they can talk and can do things with you
no one ever tells you that
when theyre born its like vietnam its terrifying
thats too scary
we used to have fun she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos but now shes tired of it all she never wants to leave the kids she doesnt need me and they dont need me i feel like im in the way it gets complicated when you have kids that changes everything

john what are you doing here
were still going to be together
you really had me going claire i was finally ready to propose to you
listen to me i love you peter im trying to protect you
so youre going to kill her put the gun down claire
shes been stalking you peter
i found the pentacle
honey youre exhausted do you want to lie down for a little while
i thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer
must be a spare set
i found them in your file box
i dont know what are they
whatre these
this is the personyou were talking about
claire
there you are my god darling ive been so worried are you alright
i believe in you
you need to believe in something besides yourself
im just temporarily off my game
well it shattered your faith in everything
its with me all the time claire i just dont like to talk about it
like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic
yeah like
no of course not but i think now that this has happened a lot of things can start to come out
youre glad somebody tried to kill me
i dont know in a way im glad it all happened
im gonna have to get a restraining order what a nightmare
thank god he did
i cant believe will killed him
im still shaking
when did they find her
yeah i appreciate it thanks josef
what happened
what thats horrible
well its a nice surprise should i hit the stop button
i spaced out
forgot my car keys what are you doing on the fourth floor
hey what are you doing here in the middle of the day
no of course not mmmm anago my favorite
oh peter youre going to pursue this
now that youre on tv youre a magnet for all the wackos out there
says she can get me in to see this killer
did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings
sorry its justa strange woman waltzes into my office today tells me she murdered her parents and can prove satan exists
peter where are you
you know there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why were losing daylight quarks and dark matter things like that even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast you know
hmmm
i cant believe its already starting to get dark so early
sushi
uhsureiwhat
i must really be slacking off hungry
weird the book again sex spelled backwards
bad
shi sorry honey i was having the weirdest dream
its probably trivial
you never said anything to me
its susans cooking claire thats why uncle james lets them stay
its great of you to let william and susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet
shes a talk show host they cant be charmed by definition
howd your interview go im sure you charmed the hell out of sally
do you think they have a room here
i missed you
eight that okay
what time did you make it for
you know i made a reservation at marcos for peters birthday dinner but maybe you should cater it
yes its exactly
you wearing a watch father
well if peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you
frustrating form over content everythings so retro
nonsense its all of our home so hows work treating you
peter are you okay
what ajerk
of course not they put him through severe mental stress causing this aneurysm
so you dont believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural
you should know i never felt mr birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care and then minutes after they left he suffered a stroke hes comatose no brain wave activity at all
no i wasnt actually
youre aware that this woman was party to the socalled exorcism
my secretary
when your secretary called she made no mention of her coming too
quite a compliment coming from you doctor
mr kelson what a pleasure to meet you i have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable i am a fan
i had to there was no other way their deaths were part of the greatest legacy i could have given you
you killed my parents
you are my son dont you see the opportunity that lies before you
you raised me like a son
everything i did i did for you i love you peter think of it im giving you a gift absolute power and knowledge
you lied to me my whole life everything you said everything you did
it was perfect the harder i pushed the more you pulled away
so all that bullshit about god and faith
dont you get it they had their years now its our turn
you fucking bastard
you know i respect that you have such faith james i dont understand it but i want you to know that despite our differences i admire you and i always will
peter your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you
but its true i have no faith its strange when that gun was pointed at my face tonight i was surprised but never frightened it was as if i knew nothing could possibly happen to me andin that one moment i didnt care about anything not eve my own life
no matter my son he believes in you
youre right but its funny all my life i thought i was simply a man who didnt believe in any of it
listen to me peter you cant let the ravings of a madman disturb you okay
yeah it didnt make any sense
he spoke to you
something he said just before
what is it
given all thats happened i understand the world is random but then theres faith where are you in death without it
you know how i feel the world is random the only certainty i believe in is death
between your book sales and this tv thing theres going to be no living with you and let me guess you boiled god down to a conceit
you ready
howre you doing looking lovely as always
its me put the gun down maya
oh peter
not a lot
how much time do we have
and whats that mean
book five deuteronomy chapter seven verse five but this shall you deal with them you shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire
and his message was together no matter what
he was trying to tell me something
terrific
thats his i dont know his grounding phrase for me together no matter what
what did he say to you in french
hes been repeating that since birdsons exorcism i looked in every passage in the bible and theres nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything
so what does it mean the ark sank and the sun set
ill be all right peter at the very end i think father was back i saw it in his eyes
you have to be experienced to do this just wait outside otherwise you risk killing him
what can i do
sure
maybe i should check lareauxs book its in the car be right back dont go anywhere
i dont know extra apartment keys whats it matter
what are these
plenty of time
only your body will remain i believe your soul will be at peace if we kill you satan cant stay
what about after
until it happens youre still a human being
why didnt you just go along with townsend get rid of me i wouldve
maybe thats my problem
no oxygen to the brain
i know it is right after my parents died i went to the beach i was in the water everything was calm and then one of those really big waves hit me hard pulled me straight to the bottom i struggled and finally ran out of air if it hadnt been for my sister who pulled me out i wouldve drowned legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me
close call for the first time in a long time its really hitting me lifes tenuous
i was desperate i knew you wrote about murders i needed a way in
why did you lie to me about your parents deaths
thats true
you have to say that
were going to do this
im scared im slipping back
i see things my worst fears you need to know something peter i was possessed once like birdson it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it
what do you mean
sometimes when i feel weak i have thesevisions
are you alright
comfort
whats the bible for
theres nothing else here
i dont know probably have a copy of my birth certificatemy apartment
he couldnt stop us and thats how he was punished peter what time were you born
that cant be right my birthdays tomorrow
itll happen at the exact time of your birth
your rd birthday the transformation will be a perversion of christs rising from the dead townsend discovered it in one of lareauxs books
hang on get it up go on higher
what
whens your birthday
you okay
what
peter let go of the chair
whats theoh shit
get up
ill go outside and take a look in the garage
nothing yet
im going to look around
we needed to know all we could
the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out
what are you looking for exactly
townsend he had some of fathers books
when townsend tried to kill me he said something strange like the time of transformation is near
i dont know i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way i dont know if it works the same way in this instance i dont even know when its going to happen
and if what youre saying is true what would happen to me
peter i believe your baptism was perverted look at your certificate your mother was the only witness to it your bloodtype doesnt match who you thought your father was peterim sorry
then why are you here
sothen the coroners report is probably wrong i meanthis is ridiculous theres been a mistake i dont believe any of this
peter your bloodtype is ab negative theres no way your birth father can be o positive you father is not who you think he is
i looked at the coroners report my fathers o positive and my mothera negative
do you know your parents blood types
yes
seven years one baptism hes your mothers only brother
so what
the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford
yes i know
you were not baptized at least i dont believe it was christian your baptism was performed by your uncle james mckenzie
but i was baptized and i certainly wasnt born of incest
theres no reason why you should this has been planned from your birth you fit all the criteria that we know of never baptized born of incest devoid of faith
i dont understand whats going on
if you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again
youre about to become the antichrist who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world
my parents are dead dont even think of bringing them into this
i know this sounds crazy i understand check your parents blood types are you sure your parents are your birth parents
im not going to be drawn into this
youre already contaminated its why you couldnt hear the tape theres probably a pentacle near your bed to sanctify you
you should think about getting professional help
the good outwitting the bad its like birdson had a split personality
trick him
if youre possessed you cant reveal anything satan wants hidden unless you trick him
why didnt birdson just say so
its true birdson knew your name he was writing it in numerical code it wasnt easy but i figured it out it spelled your name
what
at the exorcism birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man you are that man peter
and the point is
townsend believed just as god became man in christ so satan will assume human form i believe it too
why did he try to kill me
please the children
last night a guy named john townsend tried to shoot me and now i find out you knew him what the fuck is going on
peter please
we need to talk
well why should i alright whats your name where do you live when did you kill your parents
thats their explanation you might not believe me
and this is evil the guy had an aneurysm and now hes in a coma
i had to
where do you get off pretending to be my secretary
youre right i mustve made a mistake
so whatd i miss
i cranked it all the way up nothing but hum
youre sure there was nothing
it was blank nothing on it you gave me the wrong one
what do you mean
i think you gave me the wrong one
sowhat did you think of the tape
well i think its very simple heres a tape of birdsons exorcism ill be at the public library tomorrow at if you want to meet him
the world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil unfortunately i find it much more slippery and elusive place
on television you seemed so sure of yourself if youre really that confident youd be willing to let someone prove you wrong
ill bet
an exorcism was just held for birdson it failed disastrously which means theres still a demonic spirit present in his body i was wondering perhaps youd like to go meet henry hes pretty amazing
i do
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed you realize how rarely they make that ruling
whats that got to do with you
do you remember henry birdson the math professor who won the salwen medal then went home and killed his family
well then it all seems to be working out for you listen ms
in the end the jury saw it my way
oooooohkayyyyyy
i murdered my parents mr kelson and while they deserved it i still went to confession the following sunday
well by saying that youre acknowledging the existence of a higher power which to a narcissist is impossible
and i also believe in god and the devil in fact i know they exist
a narcissist doesnt admit it its the extreme of selfdenial
what if i told you i was a malignant narcissist
not the most popular opinion but yes
that there is no such thing as evil with a capital e
listen im sorry but im running late
and also that
not pure evil thats correct
you said that malignant narcissism was not evil
thank you do you work in the building you coming from the party
i saw you on television yesterday you were brilliant
yes and you are
peter kelson
may i help you
as a narcissist he couldnt blame himself he created the voices after the fact
oh my god
goodbye
get out of here
you do know dont you that these are also numbers greek numbers and or the sign of the devil
suit yourself but does this mean anything to you
you know what you can go
viznick will get off and michaels got a crush on you
nothing you couldnt find out from reading the papers and youre already wrong on one count
but she worships you your mothers dead but your fathers alive
you are the younger of two
id appreciate it if youd put that back
nice suit
ill be at bedford tonight if you need me
the police used him as a witness in this case
i think its gonna be a waste of time
he can see you thursday
what about that psychic whats his name szabo
mr kelson heres the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism
we millionaires yet
good of you to stop by
its detective smythe
yeah
you watch one day ill hit the jackpot get the big house car clothes ill have more money than god
you know what they say you have the same chance of winning whether you play or not
sometimes i can just feel the numbers
lemme guess the lottery
i plan to you want a tip
of course
would you sign it for me
and what about you what about peter kelson where is your moral compass
right if you believe in god as a narcissist viznick couldnt blame himself for the alleged murders he created the voices after the fact in order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides george viznick and that george viznick needs to pay
meaning viznicks a man who answers to no one not even god
well george viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum viznick is not psychotic hes simply unable to submit to any higher authority
are you saying hes legally sane
well we all have a degree of narcissism sally but a malignant narcissist is dangerously selfobsessed
what do you mean by that
as if theres another cause for little voices no sally viznicks a manipulator hes clever he has what i call malignant narcissism
not even from some mental illness as the prosecution asserts
there werent any voices
youre referring to the defenses efforts to prove that george viznick is tormented by demonic voices
no the less mystifying good and evil are only illusions there is no such thing as evil with a capital e that suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings
its as if you are saying the closer you get to evil the less evil it becomes
well longterm exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject after awhile you begin to make friends with it so to speak
peter youre now writing a book about the viznick case you seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers i have to ask how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day face to face with alleged killers
thanks for having me sally
as a part of todays story on the trial of mass murderer george viznick we welcome peter kelson author of the current bestseller vicious intent thank you for joining us peter
had to let her go i see you thinkin there superstar dont
where is she now
we hauled her in earlier but didnt have anything hard to tie her to townsend far as the priest goes he wont be bothering you suffered a complete mental breakdown during get this during an exorcism

im just giving you the truth there was a time when william parrish liked the truth
im feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me
yours
whose
with all due respect you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again therell be blood on the floor
i dont care
what do you think the board is going to say when i tell them that
over my dead body
if i read this board right now they want you to accept bontecous offer
what are their feelings
yes you made your feeling abun dantly clear now they want to do the same with theirs
what is there to say they know what john bontecou is and if they didnt they know now
sure
okay well see you tomorrow
i have to go bill its been a helluva day need a few minutes to sort everything out
please drew
mind if i throw up
please dont worry about him and above all dont antagonize him
for how long and why
youre competitive soul drew thats what makes you a great addi tion to the money joe is just around
as much as joes
i was a little abrupt with you this afternoon drew forgive me i want you to know i value your advice
well now its undone okay forget bontecou scrub him im tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer im not going for it
i thought this was practically a done deal
joe cut it out and you too drew
i was hired you told me to help bring parrish communications into the st century this merger is the vehicle
why
how nice for you both
joe and i have no secrets from each other
before i do i was hoping we might be alone bill
sit down drew
just kidding
no
but the matters still on the table bill
shall we adjourn
glad i could be of some help
i am now
youre not familiar with the phrase in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes
thats your privilege bill but given our needs given the absolute necessity for growth given the fu ture the truth is joining john bontecou is every bit as certain as death and taxes
sorry i know it looks like im reversing my field
sounds like youre not leaving much room for discussion
i get the feeling youve done some business before
no
uh hes from out of town
have we met
like smith or jones
what do you mean
is there any more to it
yes
joe
what
sorryum you you know its gone right out of my head
oh excuse me this is uh this is
yeah something he goes by
olympic
as close as a deal could be
so board convenes tomorrow youll recommend we close and its a deal right
you have a way with words
like a marriage made in heaven
i thought it was great i thought you and big john would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop instead it was
me too
im all excited
thats great wait til i show it to bontecou
our first annual report must be thirtyfive years ago now i owned two stations i wrote down a state ment of purpose that one day you would wake up to a parrish radio station read a parrish paper at breakfast catch our news on tele vision during the day and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain have a good time
bill after this deal youll be able to afford one
do you think i need a haircut
its going to be great
sounds good
tomorrow we sign off photo opportunity you and big john itll lead network news okay so far

i dont want to get rich this way im going to expose you
the trains left the station pal and youre aboard would you like to hear the silver lining check that gold ive been working with john bontecou all along we had a game plan acquire parrish communications then break it apart and peddle it piecebypiece to the highest bidder i set it up for him he smacks it out of the park
but i didnt mean to do it
quince you cant unscramble scrambled eggs
im going to put a stop to this
that we did thanks to you he was wobbling mind you but you spplied the coup de grace
what have you done youve gotten the old man fired
thats what he said
its up to joe
the timing yes he says its up to joe
but he was concerned about the timing
he was interested
how did bill react to the leads youve developed
well im happy to tell you ive got good news as i was telling drew ive been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining two possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger

i can see why
i dont have any
ive got plenty of friends
i guess what im trying to say is id like us to be friends
no joe im swimming here then im going home
im sorry do you live here
drew is none of your damn business nor is where i put my mouth
when you put your mouth to his susan it seems a frequent thing

what kind of childhood did you have
i havent
you act like you never had peanut butter before
peanut butter
what are your intentions to make little dreams in coffee shops turn a womans head and i dont mind admitting it was turned i liked it but ten hours later i feel like a fool i dont get it you my father here in this house the cof fee shop its making me upset and i dont like being upset who are you anyway and what are you eating
that is not my intention
not the one i met this morning hit ting on me in as nice a way as ive been hit on in a long time but the moment you find out im my dads daughter you act like a stranger
i am joe
you appear at his side outofthe blue stay at his house eat dinner with his family its practically a first youre in the redhot center of big business and i thought you were a regular joe
big
im sorry
cant seem to escape you today
im lost
what are you doing here
thats life what can i tell you
yes
yes
i guess you have your reasons
not exactly
thank you
happy birthday bill
an indictable offense
an offense
undisclosed conflict of interest
moreover agent joe black here of course thats not his real name smelled out your involvement drew he developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence unfortunately thats known as a conflict of interest
and were very grateful
the treasury department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of john bontecou they were convinced that bontecou on past deals had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for the irs wanted to go after him and this deal offered them the opportunity i agreed to cooperate
an irs man
ill take it from here i am
he is
prepare yourself drew i am
i told you to shut up
its not necessary joe drews going to step aside
its time to put this person where he belongs
joe dont do this
get him in here
okay
i certainly hope so i loved susan from the moment she was born and i love her now and every minute in between and what i dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her who is worthy of her who is of this world of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life
are you threatening me
i dont expect you to
i dont like what youre saying
does she know where shes going
no
with you who is you did you tell her who you are
susan wants to come she says shes in love with me
well theyre mine now
those were my words bill
multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about
so thats what love is
trust responsibility taking the weight for your choices and feel ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them and above all not hurting the object of your love
which is what
some aimless infatuation in which for the moment you feel like in dulging its missing everything that matters
then what is it
how perfect for you to take whatever you want because it pleases you its not love
i love her bill she is all that i ever wanted and ive never wanted for anything because ive never wanted anything before if you can understand
susan is my daughter she has a wonderful life ahead of her and youre going to deprive her of it and youre telling me youre sorry well im sorry apology not accepted
im sorry bill
youre not taking susan anywhere and what the hell does that mean anyway
i think you heard me bill
youre what
im in love with your daughter and im taking her with me tonight
say again
and im in love with your daughter
you want to know ill tell you youre looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the valley of the shadow of death hes galloping into it and the same time the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates and oh yes i almost forgot my daughters fallen in love with death
i was just asking bill
what the hell do you care
not at all
thanks
good tomorrow after the party
yeah
you are
what are you saying that its time to go
i have the feeling that all in all what i made this voyage for has served its purpose
yes
uh
i told you watch it
cut the bill crap out you sonofabitch
may i remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor this is me so watch itbill
and i dont give a shit
i dont like your tone and i dont like your references
any universe that exists or ever existed you may be the pro joe but i know who you are and youre all fucked up
this universe
youre violating the laws of the universe
i picked you for your verve your excellence and for your ability to how shall i say instruct youve lived a firstrate life and i find it eminently usable
yes and stop repeating everything i say and turning it into a question spooning fooling around god knows what you arrive on the scene why you picked me i still dont under stand
spooning
well you goddam well should you walk into my life give me the worst news a guy can get have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi ness and with my family and now youre spooning with my daughter
with all due respect bill im not asking your permission
im her father
ill be the judge of that
well youre at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman
yes i saw you see me
im sorry to hear that
i couldnt sleep
then i cant help you
im not hungry
never mind im tired im going to take a nap
fish
what okay is its okay its over weve got bigger fish to fry dont we joe
just a manner of speaking
whats okay
thats okay
im sorry bill
goodnight
okay goodnight
um not right now
hello would you like to join me quince and allison for a nightcap
hello bill
are you going to fire me bill
how about you telling me when i ask a simple question i expect a straight answer thats what im used to anybody who doesnt give it to me i fire
you tell me bill
what way would you put it
i wouldnt put it that way
about susan
i guess
you were just curious
i dont know
why did you go to the hospital
easy bill youll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation
and i dont need your goddamn permis sion either you drew i dont need anyone to tell me how to run my life
okay
i dont want anybody buying up my lifes work and turning it into something it wasnt meant to be a man wants to leave something behind and he wants it left behind the way he made it and he wants it to be run the way he run it with a sense of honor of dedication of truth okay
why at this juncture are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters
absolutely
dinner absolutely
this part im interested in
i thought youd heard a trillion times
welli dont know
why didnt you stop me
and more
cold lamb sandwiches not as chewy as roast beef not as boring as chicken she knew stuff like that

i dont deserve this im still young this is not my time
not this
theres one to every rule
make an exception
how about giving a guy a break
yes bill
joe
so youve grasped the idea con gratulations now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about
of course
so you understand the concept then when youre busy here your work what your task is is being executed elsewhere
i guess so
you were hatching ideas making plans arriving at decisions right
what do you mean
when you were shaving this morning you werent just shaving right
youve got a deal
yes
bill
you give your word i give mine that well do what we say its a truth exchanged between two people
a deal
it is a deal
sounds fair enough
and i wont tell anyone who you are
and what
oh i wouldnt tell them anything bill youll ruin the good start we had last night i felt as if i were being treated like a person joe this and joe that a nice smile quince passed me the rolls no rapture or passion or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting but i am cer tain should you uh say uh who i am our adventure would end abruptly
um well i didnt sleep too well this is crazy this is the left field thing of all time what do i do what do i tell my family
feeling i feel fine how do you feel
how are you howre you feeling
good morning bill
good morning
good night to you bill
and uh i guess goodnight
not at all
well thank you for letting me know
closer than that
i hope you realize billin your office this morning that was your time
no
your doctor did your doctor say anything about a tiny undetectable hole in your aorta did he mention an irreparab ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain were there any prognostications about the possibil ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in gstaad
i just saw my doctor he told me everything was fine
thats the best i can do but minutebyminute i find myself lingering
when you go i go
youre putting me on the spot bill
how long have i got
i wont
if there is anything else dont hesitate
no
thank you would you like the mans name
what a good idea
it hadnt occurred to me until then i was just having such a wonderful time besides isnt this what im here for
i wish you had said something to me about staying here
no
so theres nothing between you and susan
i didnt know her the body i took knew her the man she met in the coffee shop this morning i uh took him
shook me up i mean that you knew her and everything
threw you where
im sorry im a little discon certed that stuff between you and susan uh threw me
thank you
joe thats the kitchen
joe knows what youre saying just being polite
no

when i introduce you if i say who you are i dont think anyone will stay for dinner

it just occurred to me
of course
excuse me could i say something
bill i am eating dinner with you and your family and thats what were doing its not open for discussion nothing is dont you understand
this is crazy youre not going to eat dinner with us
and then
you should hope quite a while
i do how long will you be staying
you fill the bill bill
you want me to be your guide
the jacket and the pair of pants came with the body i took let me ask your opinion do i blend in
youre not death youre just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants
thats me
death
yes
yes
you are
youre coming to take me what is that who the hell are you
i am not a dream
am i dreaming this are you a dream
yes bill the question
the question
bill come on the question the question youve been asking yourself with increased regularity at odd moments panting through the extra game of handball when you ran for the plane in delhi when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning the question that is in the back of your throat choking the blood to your brain ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself
what question
yes is the answer to your ques tion
yes what
in return youll receive minuets days weeks im not going to go into details what matters is that i stay interested
im sorry
watch it
what the hell are you talking about
time
get what
show me around be my guide and in return you get
the one to do what
it requires competence wisdom experience all those things they say about you in testimonials and youre the one
take me where
i want to have a look around before i take you
about what
just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity ive been around that long but its only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest call it boredom the natural curiosity of me the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you
what the hell is this who are you
the great bill parrish at a loss for words the man from whose lips fall rapture and passion and obses sionall those admonitions about being deliberately happy what there is no sense living your life without all the sparks and energy you give off the rosy advice you dispense in round pearshaped tones
quiet

im here
where are you

what are you afraid of dad that ill fall head over heels for joe well i have as you did with mom thats always been standard whether you like or not
you dont know anything about joe
why a man appears at your side almost never leaves it you clearly trust him depend on him i sense you value him deeply why arent those things good enough for me
this is crazy
love passion obsession all those things you told me to wait for well theyve arrived
i dont understand
because i was sitting in a staff meeting incredibly bored my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was joe
i dont know
where is he
joe
wheres joe
its something
then what is it
when you say nothing that way its not nothing
nothing
now we love drew and joe in verbo ten whats going on
i dont think this is the lightning you are looking for drews a good man i know i didnt seem to be completely in his corner before but ive come to appreciate
then what will you say
i wont say you may be getting onto shaken ground
well remember how you told me about lightning striking the nature of its in there somewhere
what is the nature of your interest in joe
raise away
do you mind if i raise a little caution flag
yeah its good to get together
that was wonderful
will it
itll come back daddy
cut it out susan you and ive got to talk big day tomorrow everybody joe lets go
funny i dont get that feeling maybe its because you found out im bill parrishs daughter
incidentally joe what
uh will that hold you joe
this morning the corinth coffee shop he was looking for a doctor
what
weve met
you know each other
yer damn right
well go get em pops

nothing im sorry
daddy whats the matter
he doesnt care but thanks anyway
thank god

youre terrible
you wont tell him and even if you did hed clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the commencement speech at wharton
i wont and when i tell drew about it he wont either
stay open who knows lightning could strike
im sorry but give it to me again the short version
aw youre tough
bravo
i know its a cornball thing but love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with i say fall head over heels find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived
be deliriously happy im going to do my upmost
be deliriously happy or at least leave yourself open to be
thats all
well it worries me i want you to get swept away i want you to levitate i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish
dont get dirty dad
oh yes i am not an ounce of excitement not a whisper of a thrill this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice
youre not listening
thats for me im talking about you its not so much what you say about drew its what you dont say
so whats wrong with that
listen im crazy about the guy hes smart hes aggressive he could carry parrish communications into the st century and me along with it
what were you going to say

hi
okay ill tell her
then tell her ill come by in the morning we need to talk
no idea
you dont know where loretta is
he doesnt like you thank you for answering my question
no thats really it thank you for answering my question
i dont know
thats it thats the reason
i dont know maybe because he fears death
but why would a man need more than one woman
well theres the bible story god took a rib from adam and made eve maybe men chase women to get the rib back when god took the rib he left a hole there place where there used to be something and the women have that maybe a man isnt complete as a man without a woman
that was my fatherinlaw who has a wrong idea in his head listen johnny theres a question i want to ask you and i want you to tell me the truth if you can why do men chase women
who was that
yes
thats incredible
the breath had almost totally left her body she was as white as snow and then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house the mourners and me and herself she ate a meal that would choke a pig
youre kidding
my mothers recovered
a miracle well thats news
thats what i came to tell loretta theres been a miracle
what are you doing here youre supposed to be in palermo
maybe i should go
yes
its late
out i dont know where i was waiting up for my husband
where is she
so
shes not home yet take off your coat and come in the living room ill make you a drink i wanna talk to you
can you wake up loretta i need to talk to her
come on in
i came right from the airport
moving in
and you are a son who doesnt love his mother
youre fortytwo years old johnny and mama is still running your life
because my mother was dying but now shes not
it was a miracle
im sure she did
of course i want to
well yeah you may not want to
have you come to make peace with me
good
ronny our mother has recovered from death
johnny
loretta
its nothing
thanks comrade
absolutely
dont mind about me but could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her and bring me a big glass of vodka
she didnt hear me she asked me to repeat so she could understand what i said but i wouldnt repeat it outta shyness so im a bachelor
what happened
when i was twentyseven years old in jersey city i asked a woman to marry me she had red hair she smelled a jasmine she wore black shoes with pointy white tips
i am alone in the world
do you have a girlfriend
sure
may i presume to ask you a question
definitely
can i get another one of these
but absolutely
could you do away with her dinner and any evidence of her and bring me an big glass of vodka
yes
good night
im freezing
sure
good night can i kiss you on the cheek too
good night
im too old for me thats my predicament
im too old for you
we could go to my apartment you could see how the other half lives
youre a little boy and you like to be bad
im a little cold
no i think the house is empty i cant invite you in because im married and because i know who i am youre shaking
people home
no
i guess you cant invite me in
yes
temperatures dropping
yes
you knew that man
sure
may i walk with you a ways
what you dont know about women is a lot
i teach these classes ive taught for a million years the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago i started off i was excited about something and i wanted to share it now its rote its the multiplication table except sometimes sometimes im droning along and i look up and theres this fresh young beautiful face and its all new to her and im this great guy whos just brilliant and thinks out loud and when that happens when i look out among those chairs and look at a young womans face and see me there in her eyes me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was then i ask her out on a date it doesnt last it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months but then she catches on that im just a burnt out old gasbag and that shes as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini and at that moment she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face or some action to that effect
maybe listen you wanna know why i chase women i find women charming
i think its because they fear death
nerves
why do men chase women
go ahead
im not eating alone can i ask you a question

shell think its her fault for keeping me
they said you were drunk why dont you tell her the truth
and she sent no word down
im on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan id be wearing anyway thats as much as a page of the back stairs gets and that jobs only for toffs im her majestys highland servant indoors and out theres no stopping me now
shell blow hot and cold on you john she always does you want to be careful
but im the only one she trusts
shes got an army of people to get her up and out
the womans surrounded by fools she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning knowing that lot theyll still be dressing her at eight
john its not your problem what she eats
aye but will they
so someonell send it on ahead
one box of biscuits one box of drop tablets one box of pralines sixteen chocolate sponges its the same order every week but does anybody bother to check it now she has to travel all the way to balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys
you work the system right you could ask her yourself just be thankful youre not working for household the queen never lets them out of her sight but wee spats like us can slip through the net easy
aye then shes obviously not got enough to do
the goodlooking one
which one of us is she flirting with
theres love and theres behaving like you do because theres nobody to tell you not to
im not sure i do archie
you know what i mean
what
come on man theres love and theres
she loved him
three years john is that not a bit long to be grieving
its only grief makes her like she is
shes hardly a full hamper herself
if you were looking for promotion you should have picked one of the healthier ones
its better than shovelling horse shit
prince leopold is he the one who bleeds all day so what does his valet do wash his poultices for him
thats pretty good for a ghillie
sixty
how about yourself
not bad not bad
seventy a year
how much
i think he nearly ruptured his truss
so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting
not down south you dont
i speak as i find archie
you dont tell her majesty how you feel
i was just telling the woman how i feel for gods sake
so there are rules things you do and things you dont do
so
kitchen and lower house
checked and locked sir
louder girl
checked and locked sir
you wouldnt happen to know what the queens reading for recreation would you mary
i hope to go up next year
have i seen you up in balmoral mary
mary taylor sir
whats your name
are you all right barney
yeah
good shes a good girl arent you yeah shes a lovely girl and you know the queens riding tomorrow
yeah
good man and is she all right
yeah yeah i did
yeah theres a good girl have you had a look at this hoof she was limping badly i think there might be a stone in it
its cold out there tonight barney
mr brown sir
hey barney
quite
i tell you if we dont stick together on this you could find yourself first presidents opposition du royaum uni
im flattered you think so
i dont imagine you frequent the republican clubs but the fact that neither you nor i are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence the tory party has always been our party
a situation
i would talk to her myself but she wont listen to me she must be persuaded by someone she respects to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops
i see
i fear the influence he has on her the mans word is not to be credited he is an arriviste of the very lowest water shes having a bust cast of him in nero marquino marble
of course
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy
i take no account of gossip your highness
no doubt youve heard the rumors
i dont think ive had that pleasure
have you met mr lyle hes in sugar
your royal highness what a pleasure to see you here
mr disraeli maam
out of my way
well everyones entitled to their opinion
the future king
whom you address
do you know who you address sir
i said are you deaf as well as stupid
what did you say
are you deaf as well as stupid
tell her the prince of wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press
shes away to windsor tomorrow talk to her there
convey her a message
shes busy
i wish to see my mother
i beg your pardon mama
its the queens decision
back and upper corridors
checked and locked sir
youll talk when im finished
we
what happens to john brown is his business but the queens security will never be compromised
thats a tautology lad if you say the queen arranges something youve no need to say shes done it personally thats understood
the order of seating at the upper servants table is arranged personally by the queen herself
my own
by whose authority
not now he doesnt this is my place
mr carter the head butler sits there
i recommend her majesty uses the covered carriage with a full horse guard in the event of any disturbance i will ensure
the queen will be riding to st georges on the fifth
we are all of us subject to forces beyond our control mr brown even you
nobody has any rights over me
in as much as the article is about yourself i think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you
this is a slur on her good name
i dont doubt that the queen was highly amused she has always had a very healthy sense of humor
dont think i cant persuade her
i believe that decision rests with her majesty
if i find out that you had anything to do with this i will have you sacked
it can wait anything else
there are important papers from
that can wait till the weekend
shell need to sign dispatches before she retires
shell be away on friday between eight oclock and six in the evening to visit the grants in glasalt if shes to make the journey there and back in the day shes to have no distractions the night before shell take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early
yes it most certainly is
is that the queens request
go inside at once
well you tell her majesty from me if her husband was here now hed have had her out of that house and getting some air in her what the hells the point in me being here otherwise
i thought i made myself perfectly clear you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it
i beg your pardon
no
you will await your orders like everyone else unless you prefer a repeat of yesterdays little excitement
i didnt come all this way to sit on my arse
you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it you know that very well
awaiting my orders
yes i do
do you
in matters concerning the household i act on her behalf
i came down at the queens request ill take my orders from her
there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household
aye do
then well have to see what can be arranged
thats not good enough
im sure it wont be difficult to find you
i need a man who knows where i am
her highness equerry
wholl bring it to me
youll be sent a message
how will i know what she requires
im sorry
how will i know
her majestys routine at osborne house is not as you will remember it the household remains in full mourning and noone is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever as for the queens routine she breakfasts at nine thirty lunches at twotakes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five no one is allowed to leave the building while the queen is at home on the rare occasions when she is out you may ask permission to leave but only with my consent youre to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten oclock youll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires
but others will know that you acted for the greater good
shell think i betrayed her
in time she will
shell never understand it
for once in my life i am not the issue
i promised to protect her from people like you
no love
no loyalty
the greasy pole
too busy looking after themselves
they arent as watchful as you
the threat i tell them but they dont see it
see what
they dont see it
she trusts you john
her mind is set she wont change now
the truth is the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense
so
ah but therein lies the paradox it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents the longer she is away the stronger they become and who honestly can promise security against that however many doors you lock someone will always get in even here
why do you think i keep her here
you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism
no other aspiration
i said i serve the queen
but yourself what about john brown
aye
for her majesty
i do what i do
to have achieved ones ambition or to have reconciled oneself to its limits is a lifetimes work
why
then i envy yo
maybe once
was there never ambition
what i do i do for my queen
surely
i wouldnt know
the look on their faces when one walks into the room still gives one a ridiculous thrill
this is the top
oh
im not married
still someone must attend you your wife should not have let you out
its nothing
youre injured
im fine
forgive me ive called you out and you should have been resting
i dont think about it
princes and lords are but the breath of kings an honest mans the noblest work of god you must miss such magnificent views
ive been called back to london my last day i thought i might take a walk on lochnagar
you sent for me
quite
always remember you keep it tight to your shoulder you absorb the kick aim for the head then imagine its gladstone
if you hunt you kill
to shoot perhaps but not to kill
dare say you can be taught
occasionally
do you hunt
i am a blank sheet
what do you know about the highlands
a man can refuse only so many invitations from his queen it was remiss of me not to come earlier
what brings you here
yes yes it was
someone has to look after you it couldve been someone it was before
you should never have gone out in such foul weather
because i have to
then why send me back to them
when i took you out riding come rain or shine because i knew it was right for you when i kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace when i saw you safe from home to home and you didnt even know i was there all ive ever thought about is you
i will not hear any more about my safety you made me a promise and now you have broken it
for gods sake woman im just trying to keep you safe
you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most
im breaking no promises
you stand there and tell me it is my duty after all you promised me
have i ever let you down before
i cannot believe you are saying this you who i have relied on all this time
if duty and safety are served by the same end then aye i do
duty you talk about duty
the queen forbids it i cannot allow it because i cannot live without you without you i cannot find the strength to be who i must be please
i had foreseen that you would not but your majesty should understand that my mind will not be changed in this i leave for deeside
i do not accept
having considered my position here at court i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign
yes
maam
yes maam
has someone seen to those bruises
yes maam
i was told you were in a fight
yes maam
john
ill decide when its exaggerated
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated im sure
aye but there are fenians reported on the mainland
am i not safe enough with you john
dear me youll be telling me to watch what i eat next
i ordered it its for your own safety
must they always follow us
i heard something
what is it john john
aye
to keep out the cold
we took a nip of whiskey
ah well
i hope they didnt go to any trouble john
theyre ready now
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson
aye well if all you want is a good opinion then hed be sure to oblige you
of course i shall say what i have to say i always do
just say what you have to say woman what other people think shouldnt matter to you
i do not do it for others but ponsonby thinks they are good
i dont groom a horse to have it admired by others i groom it because it needs grooming
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject
that doesnt make him an expert
he has been attending at balmoral for many years
what does he know about the highlands
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming
who by
i am told so
are they worth reading
i am thinking of publishing my highland journals
craobhangeanmchno how can i possibly say that with a straight face
craobhangeanmchnofhiadhaich
those over there there
what
what are those
yes
aye maam
it is a fine spot for a bench is it not
sir henry is not alone they all wish it the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank
if prince albert were here today hed tell him a thing or two
he thought so yes
its a fine spot maam
prince albert was going to build a bench here he thought it one of the best views in osborne
and i intend to be there when shes ready
the queen will ride out if and when she chooses
because i think her majesty is wrong if ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air it is her
then why do you persist in doing it
yes maam
you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so
yes maam
mr brown
yes maam
yes that will be company for you
archie
yes you have a brother in service here do you not i forget his name
ive no family maam apart from my brothers and sisters
my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you he would have approved i am sure of my calling on you in this way i trust it does not inconvenience you too much
im glad of it
your family sent cards it was much appreciated
shes well too
and the pony
i am
you are well
aye maam
you are here safely
maam
mr brown
oh several things
what can we do
i beg your pardon
youve seen the latest cartoon in punch i take it
i came as quickly as i could
not at all dean good of you to spare the time
forgive me gentlemen im late
i have asked him to show you a little of highland life while you are with us at balmoral
yes
this is my good john brown
no maam
i stay here because i am happy is that such a terrible crime
forgive me maam i cannot speak for the nation only for myself as prime minister i confess i miss your presence but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and i should not burden you with it
i never thought to be bullied by you mr disraeli you i thought understood a widows grief
in so many ways and yet it is your presence they crave a figurehead
is that not enough
indeed and for that they are eternally grateful
then they may read about me
but i lack your prose mr disraeli
your majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance as for your people look no further than the sales of your highland journals to see in what affection the nation holds their queen you sell even more copies than mr dickens
i was trying to imagine rather upset
the princess louisa is too ill to move frankly the queens rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity youre smiling
whats her excuse this time
shes refusing to leave balmoral
in the press perhaps but shes sold more copies of her highland journal in three months than punch will ever sell in a year time to wheel her out
its questionable whether theres any advantage to be had from that direction shes never been less popular
mrs brown
who
gladstones got his party facing the same way for the first time in years we need help where is the old girl
you cant know that for sure
were going to lose
to know when hell be king
what did he want
i hope he got his mothers permission
i see the prince of wales is here
well see which way the wind blows
so
gossip counts lord aberdeen was right this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk granted it wouldnt take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning but if public opinion is against her then it doesnt do to appear too close
my dear stanley a prime minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion
surely youre not suggesting we dispense
the question is do we need her
well both
the cartoon or her majestys absenteeism
should we take it seriously
no indeed
well no rest for the wicked henry
some young page was boasting about having seen it lucky
where did you find it by the way
of course
quite i think id best take it back
yes
we think she can be dissuaded have you had a glance at the diary
dear oh dear
the queen wishes to publish an account of him
a few days when he heard the prince of wales threw the bust from the window of the royal gallery it took four hours to gather the fragments
not too protracted i hope
erysipelas
no she wasnt
a distinct flushing around the cheeks she was drunk i tell you
excellent
a fine choice sir
maam
please tell the princess and other signatories to this letter that the queen will not be dictated to or made to alter in any way what she has found to answer for her comfort do i make myself clear
maam
they are demanding the dismissal of john brown on grounds of drunkeness
what do they want
my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person
from princess helena and other members of your family
from whom
i have a letter maam
what is it
there is one other matter
is it not enough that she is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors i am not a fool i know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends sometimes i feel that brown is all i have left of albert and now they attack brown too
your majesty
noone should think themselves wiser than me it is not for any of the queens subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning it is the queens sorrow that keeps her secluded it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely
i forgive me maam i am no wiser than yourself
why not
i have no idea
who told them that
read it
again
read it
and now i am back
we were expecting you to return by six
we stayed a little longer than expected with mr and mrs grant it was most agreeable
no i shall be out walking
he thought perhaps your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government
why
lord clarendon arrives by invitation at eleven oclock followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate princess alices birthday dispatches as usual at two the chancellor writes to say that by happy coincidence he will be in cowes for the weekend he asks if your majesty might grant him an audience
of course at once
please make sure it does not happen again
im very sorry maam i cant imagine he was certainly given no instructions
sir henry mr brown is standing in the courtyard i have no wish to go riding
me ill know
so charge him with somethingwhos gonna know
youre still asking me to break the law
im sorry okaywe gotta find this guy becausehe knew vadas mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows
i think the phrase was quotsleazoid geekquot
look sergeant i know i said some things last time that i shouldnt have said at all but
i thought i told you to lose this guy
give us a break all you have to do is make a phone call
what about living in the real world pal
what about giving the other guy a break
well maybe you should join a hippie commune but let me tell you something sooner or later its gonna be your turn to take out the garbage
i would do it again in a minute
what kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in
you can do anything you want youre his sister
can i see him
uh huh a boy youve got a new brother
we have a baby
she just had a baby thats all
what happened to shelly
give my love to shelly

bye dad ill miss you
it meansim a paranoid nitwit whos never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason hes a paranoid nitwit so why dont you just say quotoh dadquot and get on the damn plane already
what does that mean
and no boys promise me oh those la people are all so corrupt youll end up pregnant and on drugsand dont come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surferand dont make eye contact it communicates an implied vulnerability
no nuns got it
i used my own money and got a great deal its a qnr five day fare which means that i have to change planes in dallas and stay over a saturday
what
i already bought a ticket
honey i know its fun to think about these things but
i think that if im old enough to accept a new baby and if im old enough to accept a new room im old enough to go to california
of course
you were just having a fight about me wouldnt you like to hear my opinion
oh yes lovely funeral gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job lots of pink rosesi used the white hearse hey how about this flowered wallpaper for your room
was it a nice funeral
she was talented but honey i wish i could help you a little more its just that your mother and i had kind of a whirlwind courtship she came to town with this traveling theater group i proposed on our second date two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone
well i kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float
oh is there anything else you remember how did you propose was it romantic
okay we need wallpaper paste hey cece
theres still a big spot on the floor
her favorite poet
the collected works of alfred biedermeyer
honey ahh guys dont wanna appear over anxious so if you think theres a boy that might like you let him know that you like him so he wont feel hes taking such a risk when hes thinking of asking you out
so youre sayingwhat are you saying
its just a question its not about anybody
what boy likes you
dad when a boy likes you does he pretend that he doesnt like you and if he pretends that he doesnt like you how can you tell that he likes you
great
seriously
seriously
dad im kidding you can have the room
oh yeah rightbetween the power mower and the weed killer
dont do that youve got the whole garage
hey why dont you just keep your room and well put the baby in the back yard

i dont think anybody should change their names that way you can always find them when you need them
what you think the guy should change his name
change my name
get married
id never do that
dont forget the girls change their names if they got married
i love the fragrance of chilidogs
its the leather bindings i love the fragrance of vintage books
yearbooks always set you out for disappointment i want mine to say nick probably wont amount to much so dont be surprised if you never hear anything about him again can we goit smells like someone left their gym bag in here
look here she is margaret ann muldovan newspaper literary magazine french club drama club debate club girls basketball and swim team with maggies combo of good looks and talent were sure to be seeing her name in lights she was gonna be famous
oh my gosh here it is
a big difference if someone found it we should keep looking if they didnt were just wasting our time
what difference does it make
i never did understand that story did someone find the needle or not
just remember the needle in the haystack
i dont mean to alarm you but im getting a nose bleed from the altitude
calm down we just have to ask ourselves where your books come from
what
vada
its not funny i mean what am i gonna do without that yearbook im lost i cant just walk around town looking for someone with a wilson high school letter sweater
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either
excuse me pardon thank you excuse me

i didnt ask for the money phil just gave it to me
i wasnt eavesdropping i was overhearing
you know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit
i got it all figured out i know she went to wilson high school so first thing tomorrow im gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook that way i can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were
and youre gonna solve the mystery
my parents had a brief but intensely fulfilling relationship shes remained a woman of mystery to this day

luckily the closer i watched the more the fault came into focus each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability

its not just a gag huh
to the twins soiree so they can paw you and drool
because i could come
the most important thing is being together
i travel every week college ball motor sports training camps
well the school will be here architecture will still be around right now
what
thank you grace there is one other thing
yes you are
that means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife am i correct on that point
yes they were
point of fact werent tims hands registered as lethal weapons
yes i would
so i think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that bruce lee arguably the greatest martial artist of all times developed for nine years that would be a fella who could defend himself would you describe tim that way grace
thats what tim said
now while i freely admit total ignorance on the subject i have heard of bruce lee and i was under the impression that bruce lee was one of the if not utheu greatest fighter in the history of martial arts
yes i did thats why tim studied it because it was bruce lees fighting style
jeet kune donow i did some research on that form of fighting and i found out that jeet kune do was a style developed by bruce lee did you know that
tim studied several styles but his favorite was jeet kune do
is that a fact well then grace could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that tim was schooled in
the style of fighting that tim studied didnt believe in belts
what was the color of tims belt
yes you are
when you study the martial arts they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level youre at in your training am i correct on that point
more or less
more or less
no but that dont mean much i was a completely different person ten years ago lets give key lime a day in court and a large glass of milk
when ya had it did ya like it
i havent had a key lime pie in ten years
the key lime is great but its an acquired taste
which do you recommend
apple pecan cherry and key lime
what kind of pies do you have
well back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad and we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors so you kids out there keep the faith cause mickey and mallory will be comin to your town real soon
how do you intend to disappear youre probably the most famous couple in america
well now me and mickey are gonna take it easy just enjoy each others company stop and smell the roses notice the color purple stuff like that
we had nothing to do with that riot that riot was just whatchmacallit
try to keep it to a minimum
havent you been listening to a fuckin word i said oh im sorry can i say fuckin i cant can i
did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room
i wondered how long it would be before wed get to be alone together and i wondered if i could wait that long
what did you think then
it wasnt till we got on the ground floor that i totally realized they werent gonna shoot unless we shot first when we got out of the stairwell i remember thinking oh my god this might work but mickey knew it would work all along there wasnt any doubt in his mind its not like there was and he just didnt show it he knew it would work
mallory what did you think of mickeys plan did you think it would work
i said wed give you an interview i never said we wouldnt kill you
looked like an interview to me
what he said we didnt know jack shit about and riot it just happened it was kismet we didnt even know those people how are we supposed to organize a riot when weve been in fuckin isolation for the past year just bleep out the fucks and jack shits i mean its not like we care if they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing let em it wont exactly keep us up at night but you said you wanted the truth and the truth is we were just lucky
divine intervention
we still got a few tricks up our sleeves
hasnt it
dont stop
mickey
thanks roll em donut
by all means knock yourself out
yeah
you got something you want to do
are we in a big hurry
now when we get out there you do what we say or its curtains if we say move you move if we say left you move left if we say right you move right if we say mole you dig a hole got it
grace id like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim if you feel up to it
naw she dont mind
now that you bring it up yes they were different men i hadnt really thought that much about it since many psychiatric opinions are by a rule sought out for this kind of situation what do you think normally happens the knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives the state doesnt work like that
i take it by your answer it was a whole new team
using the same doctors is not common practice
were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the knoxs mental state asked to reexamine them
the prison board and the doctors who examined them
who is we
whats changed mr gayle is our minds we felt they were competent a year ago a year has passed sir a year where they were under close observation day in and day out and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong
when they were found competent before they had already killed fifty people other than the fact theyre a disciplinary problem which frankly shouldnt surprise anyone i still dont see where this situation is any different then it was before so i ask you again mr mcclusky whats changed
well since that time theyve killed one person during their trail and since their incarceration theyve killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates
mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial im confused whats changed
the prison board made the decision a board of which i belong were the who the why is simple mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctors care where hopefully theyll receive the help they need
why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum and who made the decision
okay wayne step forward
yeah
youre taking us to that holding cell now all right cut
shes in the holding cell on this floor
okay buddy boy where ya keepin mallory i know shes still here and i know you know where so start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene
what
did you ever see eldorado
ive never wounded anything in my life i got you locked right between the eyes
or what youll wound me i can blow you in half and you know it
slide the shotgun over here put your hands behind your head put your forehead on the floor

everybody thought id gone crazy the cops my mom everybody but you see they all missed the point of the story i wasnt crazy but when i was holding the shotgun it all became clear i realized for the first time my one true calling in life im a natural born killer
when have they ever been right
says the united states of america
says who
well riddle me this batman how do you feel about the fact that youre never gonna see mallory again
thats indescribable

describe mallory
im sure we will
okayokayill buy that well move on and come back later
its not that easy wayne donuts and a smoke only get you so far youre gonna have to do your job
tell me about the purity
youll never understand me and you wayne were not even the same species i used to be youthen i evolved from where youre standing youre a man from where im standing youre a ape im hereim right here and youyoure somewhere else man you say why i say why not
you just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie i dont understand whats so pure about fortyeight dead bodies
please explain to me mickey wheres the purity that you couldnt live without in five year old danny millhouses blown off head wheres the purity in fortyeight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and mallory whats so fucking pure about that
thats only part of it i mean its a big big big part but its only the chorus its not the whole song
excuse me did you say an instant of purity what was the instant of purity the bodies you left behind on your bloody trail
was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie yeah it was
no mickey i cant let you get away with that shit answer the question was it worth it you havent seen heard or smelled mallory in a year was it worth it
do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue
was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life
was what worth it
then was it worth it
of course i miss mallory shes my wife i havent seen her in a long time what a stupid question
do you miss mallory
what i did for fun for starters well something i used to doalways was a lot of fun no scratch that let me think of something else in fact why dont we come back to that question ask me something else
what oh aaahhh what you did for fun for starters
much obliged what do i do for fun do you want to know what i do for fun or what i did for fun
aside from the obvious
so mickey tell us what you do for fun
lets do it
were about ready to go here are you ready
dont worry about it
sorry about that
lets discuss it when im unbound
all right mickey
okay now before we get started here theres a few things we have to get clear about
im keen with anticipation
mickey how do you feel about cross examining grace mulberry
songs hes a rebel leader of the pack town without pity that dusty springfield song i only want to be with you thats what i hear anyway her behaviour was the main thing the doctors report used against you so even if she would see me which she wont i couldnt put her on camera anyway if i ask her mallory are you insane and she starts singing dead skunk in the middle of the road that blows our whole case
she sings what does she sing
not to anybody she sings
she doesnt talk
she wont even see me mickey now youre not supposed to know anything about whats going on with her but im gonna tell ya somethin since you twove been sentenced mallory hasnt spoken one word
have you talked to mallory about this
my problem mickey is that you dont exactly inspire empathy im all alone on this i need your help i want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode now i have interviews with chairman of the prison board dewight mcclusky about this issue and im tellin ya mickey he looks bad the two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court wont talk to us which always looks bad i have an interview with both the judge of your trial bert steinsma and the psychologist and author emil reinghold both of which discount the notion that youre insane you put that all together and what the state is doing becomes obvious but the network isnt satisfied they feel the show needs another element it needs you in order to put the show on the air i need to get an interview with you you havent talked to the press since your trial now a few days before you get transferred to an asylum you grant an interview on television with wayne gayle were talkin a media event here every son of a bitch out the with a tv sets gonna tune in to see that well make their motives so blatant well shame em into dropping the whole thing at least for a little while the publicity would keep them from just giving you and mallory lobotomies well whatta ya say
weve been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time and that time has definitely come i feel its apparent to anyone whos hip to whats going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin window you and mallory may be killers but youre not insane you belong in a prison not in an asylum the prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables now some people are saying so what i am not one of those people if we avert our eyes while they do this to you we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what i say is dangerous where does it all stop
yeah its pretty hard to beat the king
manson beat you
how bout manson
what id like to do
goodyuppie piece of shit
yes yours got the larger nielson share
how bout ted bundy ever do one on him
yours
whose ratings were higher
yes
did you ever do one on wayne gacy
the episode we did on mickey and mallory was one of our most popular ones
everybody knows who you are youre famous
hello mickey weve never been introduced but im wayne gayle i dont know if youve ever heard of me or remember me i was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial
unfortunately yes
and they made the first move
they cant because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs so you may as well make the first move
why cant they just shake hands and be friends
its like this wayne two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack these two people cant see each other yet they know theyre there now they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom or one of them can make the first move
how can you say that you admire them
yes
then youve seen the scene where arnold schwartzenegger is talking to lou ferigno
yes
jesus
thats my opinion
the entire wing
ill say enough to destroy this wing
take a wild stab
its hard to say captn
what do you think pitney how much explosives do you think that they really have in there
here
where do the air ducts lead
heres the layout of the laundry room
captn
i want two men stationed in that tier and i want men with rifles all along the walkway

okay guys were here la county jail julie just park in the front
so youre giving a man who butchers whole families little babies included my chocolate cream filled
roger do you understand what the word no means its important we establish a rapport something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasnt had a donut in a year
whats the big deal take out my chocolate cream filled put one of these roasted coconut
roger no
that dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake
huh uh this dozen is for mickey
im as serious about that as i am about going back to the donut store and dipping that stupid mexicans head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled gimme that other box

are youscared
thank you
this seat taken
josie youre different when you speak in class i can tellyou actually feel the words in here theyre alive likeeurdora welty talked about the word it moon how for her it was like a concord grape that grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin
thanks wow thatsreally nice to hear
josie you owe it to yourself to go for your writing youre a natural
oh no no no no no see my family we dont go to college we just go right into sheep herding
thats crazy ill get you some applications
college havent really thought about it
so what are you thinking for college
thank you
your writing its amazing josie youre really talented and far less depressing than dorothy parker
oh i dont think so
hey josie hold on youve been hiding something from me
well im definitely seventeen and now definitely late
because seventeenyearolds do not like writers from the s they dont even like people in their s
sure why
true i guess she hadnt completely given up hope are you sure youre seventeen
but i think she wanted to be happy thats why she wrote i mean she was still writing about love right
not the happiest of souls art is a form of catharsis and love is a permanent flop
i love the way she writes
you like her
dorothy parker
sorry forgetful
whoa deja vu
im josie geller i think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling me that josie
hi everyone i don t think weve met im sam coulson although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam
relax monty its just my sister
aloha welcome
i thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time
change is scary robbie let me tell you a little something about the mail business ive been in it over thirty years and in those thirty years the only thing thats changed is the elvis stamp and some gun laws people are bored they wanna shake things up

well a shot at it
im sorry you think you deserve the brownie
wait a minute what about me
thats very good news the readers of horse and hound will be absolutely delighted
yes im pretty sure i would
and what would you say
i hoped there might be but no im assured there arent
okay fine fine good decision
i live in notting hill you live in beverly hills everyone in the world knows who you are my mother has trouble remembering my name
i see that reality is a real no isnt it
with you im in real danger it took like a perfect situation apart from that foul temper of yours but my relatively inexperienced heart would i fear not recover if i was once again cast aside which i would absolutely expect to be there are too many pictures of you everywhere too many films youd go and id be well buggered basically
the truth is
yes thats fine of course i you know of course ill just be getting along then nice to see you
can i just say no to your kind request and leave it at that
thats fine theres always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict
sorry about that
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england
but yesterday that actor asked you who i was and you just dismissed me out of hand i heard you had a microphone i had headphones
yes the thing is i have to go away today but i wondered if i didnt whether you might let me see you a bit or a lot maybe see if you could like me again
you were saying
whats the thing
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought youd but when it came to it i didnt know how to call you having behaved so badly twice so its been just sitting in the hotel but then you came so i figured the thing is the thing is
okay well thank you i dont know what its for but thank you anyway
no dont open it yet ill be embarrassed
thank you shall i
i thought id give it to you
oh no its all nonsense believe me i had no idea how much nonsense it all was but nonsense it all is well yesterday was our last day filming and so im just off but i brought you this from home and
fine everything much the same when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately whereas you ive watched in wonder awards glory
well how have you been
yes im sorry i had to leave i didnt want to disturb you
you disappeared
hello

its not going very well and its our last day
i was going to ring but i didnt think youd want to
i only found out you were here yesterday
this is certainly ah
you really dont get it this story gets filed every time anyone writes anything about me theyll dig up these photos newspapers last forever ill regret this forever
well you know its just one day todays papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow
excuse me
i mean todays newspapers will be lining tomorrows waste paper bins
youre right of course youre right its just that ive dealt with this garbage for ten years now youve had it for ten minutes our perspectives are different
thats not true and wait a minute this is crazy behavior cant we just laugh about this seriously in the huge sweep of things this stuff doesnt matter
and remember spike owes you an expensive dinner or holiday depending if hes got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal
i dont want a goddamn cup of tea i want to go home
now stop stop i beg you calm down have a cup of tea
who knows it may even help business buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott
thats spectacularly unfair
you can stay calm its the perfect situation for you minimum input maximum publicity everyone you ever bump into will know well done you you slept with that actress weve seen the pictures
i know i know but just lets stay calm
as far as theyre concerned i do and now tomorrow therell be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to timbuktu

this is such a mess i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now im landed in it all over again for gods sake ive got a boyfriend
really the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought hey i know where anna scott is shes in that house with the blue door in notting hill and then you go out in your goddamn underwear
thats not true
i do your furry friend thought hed make a buck or two telling the papers where i was
i dont know what happened

her most famous part men went to bed with the dream and they didnt like it when they woke up with the reality do you feel that way with me
who was gilda
rita hayworth used to say they go to bed with gilda they wake up with me do you feel that
actually i cant think really let me just have a quick look
but theyre oddlooking theyre for milk your mums got them you must have seen a thousand of them whats the fuss about
more than that actually when you think about it you know meatloaf has a very nice pair
no seriously i mean theyre just breasts every second person in the world has got them
well
what is it about men and nudity particularly breasts how can you be so interested in them
oh god yes im sorry

okay
oh please sod off

well thank you anyway time for bed or sofabed
today has ben a good day which under the circumstances is unexpected

its one hell of a job what do you put on your passport profession mel gibsons bottom
definitely ths is important stuff
would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own
i could have a stunt bottom yes
you have a stunt bottom
definitely you may show the dent at the top of the artists buttocks but neither cheek in the event of a stunt person being used the artist must have full consultation
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity
the thing thats so irritating is that now im so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses
big feet large shoes
no whats that
you know what they say about men with big feet
yes always have had
youve got big feet
yes happiness wouldnt be happiness without a violinplaying goat
with a goat playing a violin
i do it feels like how being in love should be floating through a dark blue sky
you like chagall
and i think the book is the poorer for it
yes i mean you never get anyone in wings of a dove having the nerve to say inform the pentagon that we need black star cover
im sure youd be great in henry james but you know this writers pretty damn good too
you think i should do henry james instead
gripping its not jane austen its not henry james but its gripping

thank you
youre welcome and may i also say heavenly
no i better be going thanks for your help
do you always say no to everything

orange juice probably not

fine
no thanks ill just look around

right
bella this is anna
dont even ask
hes cooking guinea fowl
hiya sorry the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected
is miss scott staying here
bloody hell this is fun
it was sort of sweet actually i mean i know shes an actress and all that so she can deliver a line but she said that she might be as famous as can be but also that she was just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her
well you know anybody saying they want to go out with you is pretty great isnt it
what
thats nice
yes sort of
but she said she wanted to go out with you
well obviously its me isnt it i work in the city in a job i dont understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me i havent had a girlfriends since puberty and well the long and short of it is nobody fancies me and if these cheeks get any chubbier they never will
bernie
wheres bella
and we intend to use them
if anyone gets in our way we have small nuclear devices
im not saying its a bad thing in fact i think its something we should take pride in im going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here

but ringo starr doesnt look anything like topol
thats right topol
topol
would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though wouldnt it do you know this is pretty incredible actually i once saw ringo starr or at least i think it was ringo it might have been that broke from fiddler on the roof toppy

shall i go get a cappuccino ease the pain
classic absolutely classic profit from major sales push minus

which means you wont be distracted by the fact that shes back in london grasping her oscar and to be found filming most days on hampstead heath
no dont think i do
dont give a damn about the famous girl
i believe i have
so youve laid the ghost
but i wish to make it clear ive turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy
theres an understatement there are dead people on better form
yes i feel i must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months i have as you know been slightly down in the mouth
any more announcements
is it someone we know
wait a minute im your brother and i dont know anything about this
no really one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say indiana jones and the other who seriously ought to have known better casually marries my best friend
thats not fair
i think you have forgotten what an unusual situation you have here to find someone you actually love wholl love you the chances are always miniscule look at me not counting the american ive only loved two girls in my whole life both total disasters
shes perfect perfect
well
really
every time but dont despair i think i have the solution to your problems
buggered
lets face facts this was always a nogo situation annas a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods

no did you
you didnt know she had a boyfriend
i think you do yes
so i get the brownie
you see it means yes

no fraid not
bollocks bollocks bollocks have you seen my glasses
does flintstone mean anything to you
i think she said her name was flintstone
what
try flintstone
absolutely no idea remembering one names bad enough
which was
well it was genuinely bizarre she said hi its anna and then she said call me at the ritz and then gave herself a completely different name
what did she say
absolutely not
right no one else
ahm lets see ahm no gone completely oh no wait there was one from your mum she said dont forget lunch and her legs hurting again
who were the ones you didnt write down from
you want me to write down all your messages

yeh i wrote a couple down
so any messages
groovy you should do more of this stuff
no they were prescription so i could see all the fishes properly
theres something wrong with the goggles though
right vicious circle and then i was like rooting around in your things and found this and i thought cool kind of spacey
there never will be you know unless you actually clean your clothes
ahm combination of factors really no clean clothes
just incidentally why are you wearing that

theres something wrong with this yogurt
good luck
thanks great wish me luck
well yes thats perfect well done
wouldnt want that okay just one more
yes she might think you dont have true love on your mind
cool huh
point taken
yes might make it hard to strike a really romantic note
well wait for it first theres this one
what are the choices
thats right im at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure ive picked the right tshirt
this is important in comparison to lets say whether they should cancel third world debt
even he hey you couldnt help me with an incredibly important decision could you
wait a minute she took your grandmothers flowers
fabulous
how was she
oh sure of course
do you mind me not saying its a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away
im sorry which hospital
no theyre for my grandmother shes in a hospital nearby thought id kill two birds with one stone
oh right
yes
are you sure you
three
which floor
well ideally when i went back to the desk youd remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers and either wipe it and put it back or buy it see you in a sec
okay what if i did have a book down my trousers
right well then we have something of an impasse i tell you what ill call the police and what can i say if im wrong about the whole bookdownthetrousers scenario i really apologize
i havent got a book down my trousers
the one down your trousers

so
weve got a security camera in this bit of the shop
what
bad news
yes
excuse me

your great aunt
whos dying
exactly
lets face it sooner or later we all die
shes been acting weird lately though i shoulda seen it coming babbling on and on and on about communication like i dont know how to communicate
i dont get it she hasnt seen her since she was a kid now just because shes dying all of the sudden shes gotta see her again
what
but faith
ill bring it back as soon as i can

larry can i borrow your car keys
no
larry what are you doing here mom sent you
okaaaaayyyy
well know
if i live here then he lives here fate wouldnt make a mistake like that and stop talking youre gonna ruin the spell
yeah but what if he doesnt live here like what if hes a cannibal in new guinea or something
dont be stupid larry if hes my destiny then obviously he has to be alive
yeah but what if this guy lived a billion trillion years ago like what if he was a cave man and now hes dead
wait i have to write this down
im not pushing it
i brought you that too
i was hoping for the real thing
there is no us
look i just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name if you could get it out of your system once and for all then maybe youd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real granted ideally me i didnt do it to hurt you i did it for you i did it for us
if you had wanted to youd have gone home
thats not the point and what if i had wanted to
and this is the thanks i get i did you a favor you never wanted to marry that joker in the first place
yes
really
no it isnt i called off my wedding all because of you

outside of that
whats he do now tell fortunes
is that snoopy in the purple doo rag
or two
i think glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner
whatta you think
love is funny
fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying seems this womans livein boyfriend seventy years old complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelvegauge police found noodles in the womans hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him theyd been together ten years
she just sat there looking right at me
they know where i live i guess they know what i drive so maybe we should pick up another car on the way
he isnt fighting no more glenn told me the snoops been managing some guys up there now works out at the kronk
snoopy christ i thought hed be brain dead by now
remember snoopy miller his old pal from lompoc
well first off if you were glenn you wouldnt be thinking
i been thinkin if i was glenn i was up there to take down the ripper where would i go
first thing we do we get to detroit we find glenn then we find a window to throw him out of
now youre talkin
lets go to detroit
sure looks that way
i guess adeles in good hands
uhhuh
there you see the guy sitting on the porch the old ladies and one guy you know theyll have a couple more in a car somewhere
in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel thats her place
you at least bring the gun
im a tourist
nice disguise
shit
and you know theyre gonna have some people watching the hotel
her phones probably tapped
so call her up tell her dont talk to any cubans
we were talking one time drinking rum i mayve mentioned adele how she worked for a magician chino got interested hes like yeah how does he saw the woman in half he wanted to meet her or get a look at her if she ever came to visit
jack
he knows where she lives
hes gotta know by now that i gave him up back at glades he does hes gonna try to find me maybe go see adele see what she knows
hes running for his life he doesnt give a shit about you
chinos gonna wanna talk to me
you better come see this
what
well leave first thing in the morning
longer we hang around down here jack better chance there is either glenns gonna fuck up the whole score or we gonna get busted or both
am i going to detroit by myself
think this old guy is her boyfriend its the only picture she carries
youll have to ask glenn and most likely hes on his way to detroit where we should be
yeah but what happened after she drove off with glenn
just that she got away
say anything in there about karen sisco
paper says theres ten grand each on you chino and lulu
maybe thisll make you feel better

the time came you shot him but you didnt shoot foley or the guy with him theyre unarmed you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk okay now you got your sig in your hand you say in the report you couldnt turn around he had you pinned down but when the trunk opened how come you didnt cap the two guys then
and what happened to carl
yeah but i had enough reason to believe he did and i told you so you had to at least suspect him
when i was seeing carl tillman i didnt know he robbed banks
foley made me think of that fella carl tillman the one you were seeing it turns out the same time he was doing banks you recall that
it was an unusual experience
this fella holds you hostage you talk about movies

so she did help you
to warn her about chino
you were going to see her
outside adeles
where
you know i saw you on the street

i couldnt believe it i was thinking of you by then a lot wondering what it would be like if we did meet like if we could take a timeout
i wasnt sure you caught that
you waved to me in the elevator
i dont know i hadnt worked that part out yet all i knew was that i liked you and i didnt want to leave you there never see you again
what were you gonna do with me
why not
you believe that
i hear he didnt mean to the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart
he killed a police officer
i mightve smelled like a sewer but you could tell i was a gentleman they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy
yeah but in a nice way
you kept touching me feeling my thigh
she did huh
remember how talkative you were in the trunk adele said you do that when youre nervous
thats not what you were about to say
you really wear that suit
so do you
you like taking risks
it would be worth the risk
if i remembered you i came looking for you i wouldve said sure lets do it but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team why would you trust me
well id say who i was and do you remember me and ask if youd like to meet for a drink
if i had answered what were you gonna say
i called your room from downstairs
oh god
or once
it doesnt have to its something that happens its like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds theres a kind of recognition like you both know something but then the next moment the persons gone and its too late to do anything about it but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go and you think what if i had stopped and said something it might happen only a few times in your life
well does it make sense to you
its not a game something you play
its your game ive never played this before
i dont think it works if were somebody else you know what i mean gary and celeste jesus what do they know about anything
not yet dont say anything yet okay
how far do we go with this
no what do you do for a living gary
having it cleaned didnt help huh
it smelled
you did
i had one just like it well it was the same idea but i had to get rid of it
i like your hair and that suit
i dont have a problem with it
a girl
what as a sales rep
is that how you think of yourself
im a sales rep i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because im a girl
well we got that out of the way tell me celeste what do you do for a living
love it
you like bourbon
no theyre all right i meant you just got here
those guys bother you
dont leave me
i can go to the bar
it takes hours to get a drink around here theres only one waitress
i just thought maybe you and me could
whatta you mean uwellu make it an island
im partial to mountains myself but if you like islands well make it an island
one last score that the idea move to some island
hes dead he did twentyseven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital i think trying to make up for all the good times hed missed thats not gonna be me
unless you wanna tell me
why you think he might tell you where i am
something ive been wondering what ever happened to your uncle cully
i can just picture that a cute girl like you following slipandfall and whiplash cheaters
my dads retired he was a private investigator forty years i used to work for him
because youre having too much fun
why not
you wont do that
theres a guy here on the task force right now maybe i should put him on the phone let you two work it out
sure ill just leave em with the swat guy answers the door
lets see you could come on by my dads place drop em off
how do we do that
think i could have them back
and your gun
how do you know wait you have my wallet
really he has a cops face
thats my dad
im just worried maybe im not old enough for you
none of your business
who was it answered the phone
howd you get this number
yes
you know who this is
shit
get your hands up and turn around unowu
uhhuh well but if
i mean romantically
really
i never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick
yeah
with robert redford when he was young
another one faye dunaway was in i liked ithree days of the condori
you have to be kidding
im just saying i think if we met under different circumstances
youd probably tell me
i mean if you didnt know who i was
nothing
youre sure easy to talk to i wonder say we met under different circumstances and got to talking say you were in a bar and i came up to you i wonder what would happen
it wasnt pretty after no but if you were in that car eating a sandwich you wouldnt have known what hit you
bleeding on a country road
yeah right anyway that scene where warren beatty and faye dunaway get shot i remember thinking at the time it wouldnt be a bad way to go if you have to
peter finch
and the guy saying he wasnt gonna take any more shit from anybody
inetworki yeah she was good
yeah i liked her in that movie about tv
faye dunaway
that part in the movie where they get shot warren beatty and i cant think of her name
it was may near gibsland louisiana
youre full of interesting facts arent you
they put a hundred and eightyseven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving bonnie was eating a sandwich
is that right
i dont recall his hat but ive seen pictures of him lying dead shot by texas rangers did you know he didnt have his shoes on
oh you mean of bonnie and clyde hm you ever see pictures of him the way he wore his hat you could tell he had that dontgiveashit air about him
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow
yeah well if it turns out i get shot like a dog itll be in the street not off a goddamn fence
you know this isnt gonna end well these things never do
sure
we still talk though
uhhuh
it was just a year give or take a few days i mean its not like we didnt get along or anything we had fun we just didnt have that that thing you know that spark you know what i mean you gotta have that
you were married all those falls im surprised you had time
jesus you sound like my exwife
what do you want me to do scream i dont think it would help much im just gonna sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up
you dont act like it
of course i am
you dont seem all that scared
i dont have to i dont rob banks
basically yeah if i go back now i do a full thirty years no time off can you imagine looking at that
i know the difference you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary ive delivered people there so basically youve spent half your life in prison
i believe you would have another fall i did seven years at lompoc and i dont mean the place next door where some of nixons people went
it was me i woulda left ol gus on the floor
i thought so too
thats funny
tell you the truth i dont know i started when i was eighteen driving for my uncle cully and his partner gus they go into a bank this one time in slidell gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg all three of us ended up in angola
how many was that
time i was convicted in california fbi told me id robbed more banks than anyone in the computer
why are you famous
jack foley youve probably heard of me
so whats uyouru name itll be in the paper tomorrow anyway
one i gave him yeah fuck
buddy thats his given name
who buddy yeah hes a good guy back when we jailed together hed call his sister every week without fail shes a bornagain christian does bookkeeping for a televangelist buddy calls her up confesses his sins tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob
must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this
if they get set up in time which i doubt and even if they do theyll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas not a big black guy driving a ford
you wouldnt have time anyway we come to a roadblock theyll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to
guys like me huh well listen even though ive been celibate lately im not gonna force myself on you ive never done that in my life
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me
yeah went real nice with that twelve gauge too tell me why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall
i believe it youve ruined a nine hundreddollar suit my dad gave me
boy it stunk in there
in my bag in the car
wheres your gun your pistol

and the guy sent you a bill for this
the fish saved my life two years ago i found out i had high blood pressure so my doctor he tells me to go get an aquarium look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out
i cant say that ive paid that much attention to em before
yeah fish live in the present they dont dwell on yesterday and they dont worry about tomorrow even when a big fish attacks a little fish theres no neurosis involved no guilt afterward no whining on some fishshrinks couch they just do it they accept
the fish
no need to decide now be like the fish let whatever happens happen

hey jack bullshit i didnt make my first million until i was forty two fortytwo you really uwantu to change its never too late

youre the one with balls dick say something like that to someone like glenn or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute
i know what youre talking about
no where do you keep it dick im talking about all those uncut diamonds you told glenn about

you crazy come up uhereu its fuckin one degree outside
listen snoopy im on my way up to detroit and need a place to crash
studs hey son you must be one a them psychic friends i was just thinkin about you
snoopy glenn michaels
my little girl the tough babe
he knew what he was doing nobody forced him to rob banks
i was just thinking you could have a nice time with him on the plane like picking up where your interlude or whatever you call it left off and then throw him in the can
its possible why
you gonna go get him
none id like to share
he doesnt seem to hold a grudge what iii want to know is why they got such a big score up north did foley hang around miami for so long any thoughts on that one
so what i want to know is why buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in
so
buddys sister regina mary bragg got two calls from buddy up in detroit this morning called burdon shes also the one gave burdon buddys address
i imagine you wouldve though
i didnt have time
you wave back
i couldnt swear to it but im pretty sure he did
he waved to you
yeah but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping
foley ikidinapped me
you like the wild ones dont you tillman nicolet and now foley you know ive always said theres a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers all those guys that love to pack
my married boyfriend setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity i couldnt believe it
maybe but youre also curious about the man twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him you were concerned but you didnt want to show it
i want to bust his ass put him in shackles
but you know hes dirty and you still wanna see him again
not at all
he remind you of that guy tillman
hes pretty laid back confident
remember pay attention to how she talks about foley her tone do it right shell tell you things she wouldnt tell burdon tell her you think hes a nice guy no first tell her about being in the trunk with him in the dark for half an hour and see how she takes it if shes in on it what does she get for all the aggravation cops breathing on her i bet nothing so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out you think thats possible what kind of guy is he
hello
hello yeah she is just a minute for you
off a tip

i told you he isnt here

so the womans married she goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it but you dont reveal her name you protect her it sounds like youre saying its okay as long as her husband doesnt find out about it like the guy who cheats on his wife saying what she doesnt know wont hurt her
the woman also said he stole her husbands gun a twentytwo pistol and some of his clothes
thats how you score now
i spoke to her the guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him

im sorry danny but theyre only accepting the best pilots
i dont mean howd you do the paperwork i mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it
the colonel helped me work it out
how could you do this
hey you wanna test my limits you better line up a couple dozen women on the groundcause i got no limits in the air
didnt you say test the limits
theres another one
home of the brave
land of the free
good shooting rafe
good shooting danny
kill the bastards
its germans
power dive
bandits at oclock
we got a saying here alowha
yeah
whos gonna to that japan is four thousand miles away so you guys just arrived huh
what about easier to hit in an air raid
the brass is afraid of sabotage this makes em easier to protect and easier to service
hey what is this the planes all bunched up like that
hang on
so beautiful
from the air
wellsure
hey have you seen pearl harbor at night
he told me he didnt want to leave me with regret now thats all i have
sorry
i swore not to talk about him tonight but theres all this stuff i think i ought to tell you that he didnt get a chance to rafe washe was lonely he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes do you think thats why were meeting to help us say goodbye to rafe
that might not have been such a good idea theyre making us fly out of a halfpaved airfield the real punishment is that i wont be back to the barracks till its too late for dinner or coffee so i guess its goodbye for awhile
we got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident but its quiet except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us
hows everything
he said that
he said youre the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him
i taught him to drink beer he taught me how to fly
you were more like brothers
rafes folks had a crop dusting business owned their own planes real straight frugal my father was the town drunk went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the dawn express came along rafe and i were the only ones at the funeral he took me back to his house and i never left
he told me about you that he had no other friend like you
before rafe left he asked me to be the one to tell you if it happened
were isnt that what you mean were because hes dead isnt he and thats why youve come
lieutenant im danny walker im rafe mccawleys best friend
i know
colonelwere all going whether you make it or not
listen you guys im the first plane then mccawley walker the rest of you ill have the shortest run if i dont make it you dont go
i take it back about the flowers were all gonna die
i thought id made it clear im not just putting this mission together im leading it myself
i want to introduce a couple of people doc white is a flight surgeon he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission because we cant spare the weight of an extra man
bombers
in flight school you qualified in single and in multiengine planes youll be flying multiengines here
top secret means you help me pick the other pilots train and go without knowing where youre going until its too late
well sure colonel
youre just about the only pilots in the army with actual combat experience so youre volunteering for a mission ive been ordered to put together do you know what top secret is
is that the good new sir or
explain what
we can explain colonel
i heard what you did
thank you sir
good luck over there mccawley i admire your decision
thank you sir
thats bullshit son but its really good bullshit
never sir i just meant its dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit and all youve done for me sir working out the transfer i did it to say thanks to honor you sir what the french call a homage
dont get smart with me son
how could it be irresponsible sir if you were the first man in the world to do it
there are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible
it was i couldnt have you go away wherever it isto warwithout knowing something you think i made a choice of danny over you i didnt i didnt have a choice im pregnant
it must of been a convincing letter
they were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along i wrote colonel doolittle and told him i needed to see you before you go
what
thats what i have to tell you rafe it wasnt a choice it
of course i forgive you i know what you feel for danny is real and your choice is your choice
rafe no you forgive me
i need to tell you something i didnt know what it was to lose somebody to see death and find how much it scares you that you havent lived and loved enough i didnt understand forgive me
rafe
theres nothing you can do here theyll die or they wont we just
what else can we do
its not that i didnt mean everything i wrote its just that i thought you were dead and now
dont worry about that guys away from home lonely goodhearted women try to cheer them up
its not your fault rafe the letter i wrote you they
its all right danny always said i see things with my emotions instead of my eyes
im so sorry for what you mustve gone through but im back
its beenso different being so sure you were dead
nothing that wont heal i guess
im justso amazed so glad to know that youre okay you are okay arent you
i called my folks then colonel doolittle the colonel sent a man to pick me up they wanted to debrief me i told the colonel i needed to see somebody first and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour ive done a lot of talking you havent said anything
survive i jumped in a patch of fog and nobody could see me i hit the water hard and it was socold
how did you
i saw you i couldnt go in ijust stood there wondering if you knew you lookedsad and i had to sit down a minute
why were you sitting here instead of
i sent telegrams i guess the military traffic held them up
do one thing for me before you go
maybe not but i need you to know i love you and i will come back ill find a way and then well get a chance to know if what i felt the first moment i saw you and every minute since then is real
i dont know if you can choose that rafe
evelynyou know the line lets make tonight memorable what i feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that if i dont come back i dont want to saddle you with regret and sadness youll carry the rest of your life
i had to tell you in person because theres something else i need to say
you waited til tonight to tell me
colonel doolittle pulled the strings and put me on loan to the raf they need pilots and we need experience i leave tomorrow
but youre in the us army how could you
im going to the war the real war hitlers taken europe the brits are hanging on by their fingernails and if they lose therell be more people killed than anybody can imagine and not just there but here
were all going away
theres one thing i have to say im going away
it surprises me that im not the only one on this balcony who feels that way
the only reason its hard to say is that i keep thinking i dont have the right to say it but ive got to because its true i love you that must surprise you
whatever youre trying to tell me isnt good is it or it wouldnt be so hard to say
i was hoping to meet him
no hegot some news today hell be okay he just didnt feel like coming tonight

it means i care about you and what happens to you
does this mean you like me again
if you took the trouble to write it then sure ill take a look at it but im beginning to think that maybe theres more to life than music i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr excitement

fat chance you know lee wilkins came to hear me last night he told me to forget it you told me to forget it my parents tell me to forget it

confucious says the way out is through the door theres a truck theres your door
whatre you doing
theres one way to find out
am i dead or not
youre giving me the creeps
come on richard im serious
you look pretty good for a corpse

id be very careful if i were you you don t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain
i dont know
but when did you leave are you here until then were you there until now what direction are you going in are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past can anyone do it

listen youve gotta keep this a secret you cant tell a soul promise
absolutely people dogs elephants
so you think time travel is possible for people
you can till it with whatever you want from illusions to memory from experience to innocence from happiness to the entire universes
whats inside
well i think time is like a burrito sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other
i know what a burrito is
thats my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland
whats that
and then theres richards burrito
well in a newtonian framework the possibilities were limited but with the advent of relativity theory the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed
sort of
are you doing some kind of science project
i want to ask you a question do you thinktime travel is possible
im writing a book on kite construction what did you want to talk about

i dont think so you should know were going to fight you with every resource we have
we can reach an understanding on this
but i do know i also know your lines of credit are overextended if i dont buy your company someone else will ah the escargot
theres no way you could know that
youre not getting any navy contracts
were on the verge of closing a large navy contract double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares we would give you a promissory note
twentyfive percent
mr harris we know youve purchased at least twenty percent of our stock we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share
who indeed
who are you going after next sir
mr kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker its finished youve won
what
congratulations sir
i talked to some developers about the land
you what
the real estate possibilities are endless most of the yard well just level i talked to a couple of developers under the table of course and they said
not with those smokestacks its not
storage i think
whats that long building over there
youre very right i think the best thing we could all do is go home
youd be initiating a financial battle youd ultimately lose mr harris
this time i imagine you would yes hmm with all this in mind mr kross i cant logically make a formal bid on your company can i
quiet would i get the loans
i suppose youd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently dont seem aware of wouldnt you the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours youd certainly find out about that
i i dont know there there wasnt time
how
i i would take advantage of it
if you had a reprieve what would do
yes
stop for just a moment mr kross id like to ask you a few questions ubeforeu you sign you realize that youre a target if you werent mine youd be someone elses correct
youre making the right decision sir
of course yes after the uexpectedu filing period is over im going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid
uexpectedu offer
yes im here to tell you that ive reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer
not bad for a man who hasnt slept in four nights ill get used to it
how are you mr kross
mr harris
it is unotu your company its a public company and i uamu going to acquire it either i buy from the other stock holders or i buy from you
i dont question the legality of what you do its your morality that makes me sick i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal
i know all about you mr harris when you buy companies they have a way of disappearing even the pension funds are stripped clean the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces widows were left without their retirement checks
no what i have is a lot of money
youve got a lot of nerve
mr kross im not here to sell you my stock on the contrary im here to buy yours
to get me in a mood to sell double what i paid but your company doesnt have enough capital right now to buy anything
what would it take to buy our stock back name your price
its not your fault youre right kits right but i want the fairy tale
vivian
i didnt think so
i do i do want to thats why im leaving thats what you given me see i know what i want now i want a guy like you for real not because you buy me things and give me money the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand you gonna give me that

it felt good
it was good
i got tired of hating my father
it was a business decision
right youre quite the sir galahad today arent ya i heard what you did with kross
not all men hit and no one is going to hit you anymore
why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek wham so it feels like your eye is gonna explode what do they do take you all aside in high school and show you how it pisses me off
its what i do for a living its how i make money
its all just business to you him me your life everythings business

vivian lifes not a fairy tale
when i was a little girl my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad which was pretty often id stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up rescue me from the tower and then wed ride off but never ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say come on baby ill put you up in a great condo

i just might do that
yeah sure why not call me at the regent beverly wilshire
its okay edward told me your secrets safe with me
what
all this must be quite a change from hollywood boulevard
yeah thanks
having a good time vivian
you survived the fire swamp you must be very brave but nobody withstands the machine
you dont believe me
so its to be torture
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before theyre broken
then why bother curing me
till they kill you yeah
then im here till i die
dont even think dont even think about trying to escape the chains are far too thick and dont dream of being rescued either the only way in is secret and only the prince the count and i know how to get in and out
oh my sweet westley what have i done
as you wish
you mocked me once never do it again i died that day
faithfulness he talked of madam your enduring faithfulness now tell me truly when you found out he was gone did you get engaged to your prince that same hour or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead
and what am i
i asked him what was so important for him true love he replied and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness i can only assume he meant you you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are
he died well that should please you no bribe attempts or blubbering he simply said please please i need to live it was the please that caught my memory
nothing you can say will upset me
does it bother you to hear
life is pain highness anyone who says differently is selling something i remember this farm boy of yours i think this would be what five years ago
you mock my pain
i cant afford to make exceptions once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft people begin to disobey you and then its nothing but work work work all the time
on the high seas your ship attacked and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners
hardly complimentary your highness why loose your venom on me
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces
with pride what can i do for you
youre the dread pirate roberts admit it
i know who you are your cruelty reveals everything
rest highness
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream
are not capable of love is what you mean
he knows i do not love him
you admit to me you do not love your fiance
i never said he was my dearest love and yes he will save me that i know
you think your dearest love will save you
i was giving you a chance no matter where you take me theres no greater hunter than prince humperdinck he could track a falcon on a cloudy day he can find you
and what is that worth the promise of a woman youre very funny highness
if youll release me whatever you ask for ransom youll get it i promise you
catch your breath
they were both poisoned i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder
to think all that time it was your cup that was poisoned
i am no one to be trifled with that is all you ever need know
who are you
then youre not married if you didnt say it you didnt do it wouldnt you agree your highness
well no we sort of skipped that part
did you say i do
but it did i was there this old man said man and wife
it never happened
what
it never happened
i got married i didnt want to it all happened so fast
what hideous sin have you committed lately
oh westley will you ever forgive me
gently
at a time like this thats all you can think to say gently
gently
oh westley darling westley why wont you hold me
now was that so terrible
we did it
rodents of unusual size i dont think they exist
westley what about the rouss
i mean what are the three terrors of the fire swamp one the flame spurts no problem theres a popping sound preceding each we can avoid that two the lightning sand but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like so in the future we can avoid that too
no no we have already succeeded
well never succeed we may as well die here
what go on
finally roberts decided something he said all right westley ive never had a valet you can try it for tonight ill most likely kill you in the morning three years he said that good night westley good work sleep well ill most likely kill you in the morning it was a fine time for me i was learning to fence to fight anything anyone would teach me and roberts and i eventually became friends and then it happened
i myself am often surprised at lifes little quirks
but how is that possible since hes been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago
this will all soon be but a happy memory because roberts ship revenge is anchored at the far end and i as you know am roberts
you
singed a bit were you
nonsense youre only saying that because no one ever has
well never survive
there will never be a need
i will never doubt again
death cannot stop true love all it can do is delay it for a while
well you were dead
i told you i would always come for you why didnt you wait for me
move youre alive if you want i can fly
can you move at all
this is true love you think this happens every day
but how can you be sure
hear this now i will come for you
but what if something happens to you
of course you will
i fear ill never see you again
as you wish
farm boy fill these with water please
as you wish
farm boy polish my horses saddle i want to see my face shining in it by morning
well you see you use different moves when youre fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one
why should that make such a difference
well i havent fought just one person for so long ive been specializing in groups battling gangs for local charities that kind of thing
why is that do you think
why do you wear a mask were you burned by acid or something like that
and a good thing too
youre quick
i just want you to feel youre doing well i hate for people to die embarrassed
look are you just fiddling around with me or what
its not my fault being the biggest and the strongest i dont even exercise
frankly i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting
i could kill you now
you mean youll put down your rock and ill put down my sword and well try to kill each other like civilized people
we face each other as god intended sportsmanlike no tricks no weapons skill against skill alone
i believe you so what happens now
i did that on purpose i dont have to miss
oh good my way thank you vizzini which way is my way
finish him finish him your way
what do i do
give her to me catch up with us quickly
im waiting
you be careful people in masks cannot be trusted
dont say that vizzini please
i do not accept excuses im just going to have to find myself a new giant thats all
well im carrying three people and hes got only himself
you were supposed to be this colossus you were this great legendary thing and yet he gains
i thought i was going faster
faster
veer left left left
i only dog paddle
anybody want a peanut
no more rhymes now i mean it
am i going mad or did the word think escape your lips you were not hired for your brains you hippopotamic land mass
i just dont think its right killing an innocent girl
ive hired you to help me start a war thats a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition
you never said anything about killing anyone
once the horse reaches the castle the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier his suspicions will be totally confirmed

nobody nobody kills him he lives
who kills prince humperdinck at the end somebodys got to do it is it inigo who
i dont understand
who gets humperdinck
you want me to read this or not
westleys only faking right
yes youre very smart shutup
see didnt i tell you shed never marry that rotten humperdinck
it was ten days till the wedding the king still lived but buttercups nightmares were growing steadily worse
all right then no more interruptions at noon she met her subjects again this time as their queen
yes
do you want me to go on with this
im telling you youre messing up the story now get it right
well who says life is fair where is that written life isnt always fair
you read that wrong she doesnt marry humperdinck she marries westley im just sure of it after all that westley did for her if she does not marry him it wouldnt be fair
oh youre sick ill humor you so now where were we here yeah yeah yeah ah oh okay westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor
skip on to the fire swamp that sounded good
someday you may not mind so much
theyre kissing again do we have to hear the kissing part
what is it whats the matter
oh no no please
no you could read a little bit more if you want
because i can stop now if you want
well maybe i was a little bit concerned but thats not the same thing
well i wasnt nervous
the eel doesnt get her im explaining to you because you looked nervous
what
murdered by pirates is good
westley didnt reach his destination his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts who never left captives alive when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered
i dont beleeve this
it was a very emotional time for buttercup
keep your shirt on let me read westley had no money for marriage so he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea
well when does it get good
wait just wait
what is this are you trying to trick me wheres the sports is this a kissing book
hold it hold it
nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering westley around
yeah its really good
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there his name was westley but she never called him that isnt that a wonderful beginning
oh well thank you very much its very nice of you your vote of confidence is overwhelming all right the princess bride by s morgenstern chapter one buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin
it doesnt sound too bad ill try and stay awake
has it got any sports in it
thats right when i was your age television was called books and this is a special book it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick and i used to read it to your father and today im gonna read it to you
a book
open it up
what is it
i brought you a special present
wrong your ears you keep and ill tell you why
and then my ears i understand lets get on with it
i wasnt finished the next thing you lose will be your left eye followed by your right
and then my tongue i suppose i killed you too quickly the last time a mistake i dont mean to duplicate tonight
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me
ill explain and ill use small words so that youll be sure to understand you warthogfaced buffoon
i dont think im quite familiar with that phrase
no to the pain
a technicality that will shortly be remedied but first things first to the death
death first
for the last time surrender
it will not happen
i tell you once again surrender
ah but how will you capture us we know the secrets of the fire swamp we can live there quite happily for some time so whenever you feel like dying feel free to visit
i give you full marks for bravery dont make yourself a fool
you mean you wish to surrender to me very well i accept
have you ever considered piracy youd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts
you know its very strange i have been in the revenge business so long now that its over i dont know what to do with the rest of my life
in that case
no
i thought he was with you
wheres fezzik
light him
now
not yet
now
ill say how do i find the count once i do how do i find you again once i find you again how do we escape
true but thats hardly common knowledge is it thank you now there may be problems once were inside
why you cant even lift one
there we cannot help you
well why didnt you list that among our assets in the first place what i wouldnt give for a holocaust cloak
your brains fezziks strength my steel
and our assets
and it is guarded by sixty men
that doesnt leave much time for dilly dallying
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour so all we have to do is get in break up the wedding steal the princess make our escape after i kill count rugen
let me explain no there is too much let me sum up
who are you are we enemies why am i on this wall wheres buttercup
ill beat you both apart ill take you both together
your guess is as good as mine
i want my father back you son ofabitch
anything you want
offer me everything i ask for
all that i have and more please
power too promise me that
yes
offer me money
no
stop saying that
hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
okay
thank you for everything
that is a noble cause give me the sixtyfive im on the job
humiliations galore
sonny true love is the greatest thing in the world except for a nice mlt a mutton lettuce and tomato sandwich where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe theyre so perky i love that but thats not what he said he distinctly said to blave and as we all know to blave means to bluff so youre probably playing cards and he cheated
true love you heard him you could not ask for a more noble cause than that
whats that
now mostly dead is slightly alive now all deadwell with all dead theres usually only one thing that you can do
look who knows so much well it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead theres a big difference between mostly dead and all dead please open his mouth
hes dead he cant talk
your first story was better wheres that bellows he probably owes you money huh well ill ask him
i need him to help avenge my father murdered these twenty years
are you a rotten liar
this is noble sir his wife is crippled his children are on the brink of starvation
sheesh i never worked for so little except once and that was a very noble cause
sixtyfive
dont rush me sonny you rush a miracle man you get rotten miracles you got money
were really in a terrible rush
hah
sir sir
he is eh ill take a look bring him in
hes already dead
look im retired and besides why would you want someone the kings stinking son fired i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle
the kings stinking son fired me and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject while youre at it why dont you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it were closed
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years
what what
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself however since i cant have you following me either
kill me quickly
okay
get used to disappointment
i must know
no one of consequence
who are you
i am not lefthanded either
tell me
theres something i ought to tell you
i ought to be after twenty years
youre amazing
i am not lefthanded
and what is that
because i know something you dont know
then why are you smiling
i admit it you are better than i am
thank you ive worked hard to become so
you are wonderful
naturally you must expect me to attack with capo ferro
i thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain
begin
you seem a decent fellow i hate to die
you seem a decent fellow i hate to kill you
whether i am or not youve been more than fair
you are ready then
well i certainly hope you find him someday
more pursuit than study lately you see i cannot find him its been twenty years now i am starting to lose confidence i just work for vizzini to pay the bills theres not a lot of money in revenge
youve done nothing but study swordplay
i was eleven years old when i was strong enough i dedicated my life to the study of fencing so the next time we meet i will not fail i will go up to the sixfingered man and say hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
how old were you
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man he was a great swordmaker my father and when the sixfingered man appeared and requested a special sword my father took the job he slaved a year before he was done
do you always begin conversations this way
again thank you
well wait until youre ready
nothing comes to mind
you dont know any way youll trust me
no good ive known too many spaniards
i hate waiting i could give you my word as a spaniard
thats very comforting but im afraid youll just have to wait
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top
that does put a damper on our relationship
i could do that in fact ive got some rope up here but i do not think that you will accept my help since i am only waiting around to kill you
if youre in such a hurry you could lower a rope or a tree branch or find something useful to do
i do not suppose you could speed things up
thank you
sorry
look i dont mean to be rude but this is not as easy as it looks so id appreciate it if you wouldnt distract me
slow going
oh have it your way
well its the only way i can be satisfied if i use my right tch over too quickly
you know what a hurry were in
i want to duel him lefthanded
you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means my god hes climbing
he didnt fall inconceivable
inconceivable
hes climbing the rope and hes gaining on us
whoever he is hes too late see the cliffs of insanity
look hes right on top of us i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using
i dont swim
go in get after her
what
no reason its only i just happened to look behind us and something is there
as i told you it would be absolutely totally and in all other ways inconceivable no one in guilder knows what weve done and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast out of curiosity why do you ask
youre sure nobodys following us
stop doing that we can all relax its almost over
that would be inconceivable
making sure nobodys following us
you only think i guessed wrong thats whats so funny i switched glasses when your back was turned you fool
you guessed wrong
ill tell you in a minute first lets drink me from my glass and you from yours
whats so funny
i will and i choose
then make your choice
it has worked youve given everything away i know where the poison is
youre trying to trick me into giving away something it wont work
youd like to think that wouldnt you youve beaten my giant which means youre exceptionally strong so you could have put the poison in your own goblet trusting on your strength to save you so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you but youve also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied and in studying you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
youre just stalling now
yes australia and you must have suspected i would have known the powders origin so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
australia
wait till i get going where was i
truly you have a dizzying intellect
not remotely because iocane comes from australia as everyone knows and australia is entirely peopled with criminals and criminals are used to having people not trust them as you are not trusted by me so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you
youve made your decision then
now a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given im not a great fool so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you but you must have known i was not a great fool you would have counted on it so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
hmm
what you do not smell is called iocane powder it is odorless tasteless dissolves instantly in liquid and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man
i smell nothing
inhale this but do not touch
good then pour the wine
i accept
for the princess
really in that case i challenge you to a battle of wits
morons
yes
let me put it this way have you ever heard of plato aristotle socrates
youre that smart
im afraid so i cant compete with you physically and youre no match for my brains
but if there can be no arrangement then we are at an impasse
there will be no arrangement and youre killing her
perhaps an arrangement can be reached
theres nothing to explain youre trying to kidnap what ive rightfully stolen
let me explain
yes
mia
what was her name the one i met
excuse me
what was her name
what if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor what then what did your life mean who did you nurture pauly who did you love
you did miss
spare me your classical answer measurements in results taken what if i didnt miss
you did
two what if i didnt miss
dad
dont waste it pauly this is not an everyday talk just input the information and ask relevant questions one how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me to this particular switching station
you taking any medication
to isolation to an armed camp to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son
so i can move on you too
why
what
then you get it youll understand
ive been dreaming about this
wait i want to tell you something
i didnt want to leave things the way we did not this time
and glow happily ever after
that they tunnel magically through any obstacle defying the practical laws of physics in order to end up together
dysfunctional
a five hundred foot thick steel wall but the connection between these two electrons is so
shes in la hes in the bay area
inside every semiconductor you have two particles with opposite charges separated by an impassable barrier
no i didnt im listening

if she is well then nothing can be ill her body rests in capels monument and her immortal part with the angels lives i saw her laid low pardon me for bringing these ill news
mens eyes were made to look and let them gaze i will not budge for no mans pleasure i
either withdraw unto some private place or reason coldly of your grievences or else depart here all eyes gaze on us
by my heel i care not
by my head here come the capulets
thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in verona
am i like such a fellow
keep away the cats thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says quotgod send me no need of theequot and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need

why what is tybalt
but alas poor romeo he is already dead stabbed with a white wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bowboys buttshaft and is he a man to encounter tybalt
nay he will answer the letters master how he dares being dared
any man that can write may answer a letter
romeo will answer it
a challenge on my life
tybalt the kinsman of old capulet hath sent a letter to his fathers house
why that pale hardhearted wench that rosaline torments him so that he will sure run mad
not to his fathers i spoke with his man
where the devil should this romeo be came he not home tonight
romeo humours madman passion lover i conjure thee by rosalines bright eyes by her high forehead and her scarlet lip by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh o romeo that she were an open ass and thou a poperin pear romeo good night ill to my trucklebed this fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
romeo romeo
art thou hurt
forbear this outrage good mercutio
i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this nights revels and expire the term of a despised life closed within my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail on lusty gentlemen
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late
but tis no wit to go
every man betake him to his legs
not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food whippd and tormented good day good fellow
by giving liberty unto thine eyes examine other beauties why romeo art thou mad
teach me how i should forget to think
be ruled by me forget to think of her
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
well in that hit you miss shell not be hit with cupids arrow nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes nor open her lap to saintseducing gold
a right fair mark fair cuz is soonest hit
a right good marksman and shes fair i love
i aimd so near when i supposed you loved
in sadness cousin i do love a woman
tell me in sadness who is that you love
soft i will go along an if you leave me so you do me wrong
farewell my cuz
at thy good hearts oppression
good heart at what
no cuz i rather weep
alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will where shall we dine o me what fray was here yet tell me not for i have heard it all heres much to do with hate but more with love why then o brawling love o loving hate o any thing of nothing first create o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms feather of lead benvolio snickers dost thou not laugh
alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
out of her favour where i am in love
of love
out
in love
not having that which having makes them short
it was what sadness lengthens romeos hours
ay me sad hours seem long was that my father that went hence so fast
but new struck cuz
is the day so young
goodmorrow cousin
why then o brawling love o loving hate o anything of nothing first create heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of well seeming forms
here is my gold worse poison to mens souls than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell
drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
i pay thy poverty and not thy will
my poverty but not my will consents
the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law then be not poor but break it and take this
such mortal drugs i have but veronas law is death to any that utters them
and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but loves shadows are so rich in joy news from verona how now balthasar dost thou not bring me letters from the priest how doth my lady is my father well how doth my lady juliet for nothing can be ill if she be well
as the custom is in all her best array bear her to church
farewell
hie you make haste but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy than thou wentst forth in lamentation quick hence be gone by break of day sojourn in mantua
how well my comfort is revived by this
o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness this is dear mercy and thou sees it not hence
there is no world without verona walls hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death then banished is death mistermed calling death banished thou cust my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me
affliction is enamoured of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity hence from verona art thou banished be patient for the world is broad and wide
banishment be merciful say death for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death do not say banishment
wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
o let us hence i stand on sudden haste
o she new well thy love read by rote and could not spell come young waverer come go with me in one respect ill thy assistant be for this alliance may so happy prove to turn you household rachor to pure love
i pray thee chde me not whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow the other did not so
for doting not for loving pupil mine
thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline
holy saint francis what a change is here is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
then plainly know my hearts dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet we met we wooed we made exchange of vow ill tell thee as we pass but this i pray that thou consent to marry us today
be plain good son and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
i have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me thats by me wounded both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies
thats my good son but where hast thou been
rosaline my ghostly father no i have forgot that name and that names woe
god pardon sin was thou with rosaline
the last is true the sweeter rest was mine
young son it argues a distemperd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed or if not so so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not seen his bed tonight
benedicite what early tounge so sweet saludeth me
good marrow father
thus with a kiss i die
romeo whats here poison drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after i will kiss thy lips happily some poison yet doth hang on them thy lips are warm
o god i have an illdivining soul methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb o fortune fortune be fickle fortune for then i hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back
i doubt it not trust me love all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come adieu
then window let day in and let life out o thinkst thou we shall ever meet again
more light and light more dark and dark our woes
it is it is hie hence be gone away o now be gone more light and light it grows
let me be taken let me be put to death i have more care to stay then will to go come death welcome juliet wills it so how ist my soul let us talk it is not day
that light is not daylight i know it i it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua therefore stay yet thou needest not be gone
i must be gone and live or stay and die
wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
mercutios soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company
come gentle night come loving blackbrowned night give me my romeo and when i shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun o i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though i am sold not yet enjoyed o tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them
i will not fail tis twenty year till then
by the hour of nine
romeo at what oclock tomorrow shall i send to thee
a thousand times the worse to want thy light love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks
a thousand times good night exit above
so thrive my soul
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it
the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
do not swear although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens sweet good night this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet good night
if my hearts dear love
do not swear at all or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and ill believe thee
well what shall i swear by
o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable
lady by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruittree tops
thou knowst the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke but farewell compliment dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst thou mayst prove false o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
i have nights cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love
if they do see thee they will murder thee
with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore the garden walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here
neither fair maid if either thee dislike
art thou not romeo and a montague
ahhh
i take thee at thy word
tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague whats montague it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man o be some other name whats in a name that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet so romeo would were he not romeo calld retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title o romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself
aside shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
romeo o romeo wherefore art thou romeo deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and ill no longer be a capulet
she speaks o speak again bright angel
ay me
he jests at scars that never felt a wound but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it oh cast it off it is my lady o it is my love o that she knew she were
you kiss by the book
sin from my lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again
then have my lips the sin that they have took
then move not while my prayers effect i take thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
well then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
have not saints lips and holy palmers too
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle sin is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
did my heart love till now forswear it sight for i neer saw true beauty till this night
no mercutio
a plague o both your houses
i thought all for the best
twill serve ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man a plague o both your houses they have made worms meat of me a plague on both your houses why the devil did you come between us i was hurt under your arm
courage man the hurt can not be much
ay ay a scratch a scratch ay a scratch a scratch ha ha ha
farewell ancient lady farewell
i will follow you
heres goodly gear
sure witt now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
why then is my pump well flowered
right
pink for flower
nay i am the very pink of courtesy
a most courteous exposition
thou hast most kindly hit it
meaning to courtsy
thats as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams
pardon good mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
the slip son the slip can you not conceive
good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you
signior romeo bon jour theres a french salutation to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
ho ho capital punks
ay so i fear the more is my unrest
away begone the sport is at the best
true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angerd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dew dropping south
peace good mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing
o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agatestone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies over mens noses as they lie asleep her chariot is an empty hazelnut her wagoner a small greycoated gnat and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is shethis is she
in bed asleep while they do dream things true
that dreamers often lie
well what was yours
and so did i
i dreamd a dream tonight
why may one ask
if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down
is love a tender thing it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
too great oppression for a tender thing
under loves heavy burden do i sink
you are a lover borrow cupids wings and soar with them above a common bound
not i not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead
young hearts run free never be caught up caught up like rosaline and thee nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
i am for you
good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives
what wouldst thou have with me
calm dishonorable vile submission thou art my souls hate tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk
consort what does thou make us minstrels an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords heres my fiddlestick heres that shall make you dance zounds consort
mercutio thou art consortest with romeo
could you not take some occasion without giving
you shall find me apt enough to that sir and you will give me occasion
oh and but one word with one of us couple it with something make it a word and aa blow
follow me close gentlemen gooday a word with one of you
as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that names cursed hand did murder her kinsman
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and then on romeo cries and then falls down again
sir ah sir death the end of all
nurse
bid her to come to confession this afternoon and there she shall at father laurence cell be shrived and married
if ye should lead her into a fools paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behavior as they say for the lady is young and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing
his name is romeo and hes a montague the only son of your great enemy

look ill be in there later today ill come by and tell you all about it
i dont know
no im paying for the dress do you think shes still gonna run
this is about her negative attention not mine did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet
yes well my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention negative attention is attention like when women whack you on the street because of your column thats negative attention
oh yeah i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car
dont say spec like its a dirty word nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play plato never got a book advance
but ill get my normal fee right
justice yes paid i dont know they like the idea but my hands are tied with budget restraints

then youve got it if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands youll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot
okay you were right i hated my column but i can do this assignment
if she runs then its a cover story all true all accurate

you were not
this is getting serious
theyre mine im turning in my running shoes to you
used
i didnt and you being the one at the end of the aisle didnt just fix that
yes i did
i think so when i was walking down the aisle i was walking toward somebody who didnt have any idea who i really was and it was only half the other persons fault because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted so it was good that i didnt go through with it because it would have been a lie but you you knew the real me
does it matter
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career so what are you doing here
its something ive always wanted to do
livid is good so what is it maggie you here on business i saw your lamps theyre terrific
i dont have much choice in the matter now do i but i cant speak for italics traitor
ive been making friends with your cat is it okay that im here
so well
so am i
im okay with that
and the wedding date theres the two of us so you think maybe you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back
and the church
well you do have the dress

a little longer for me
about a minute
i kissed him back
im sorry bob she kissed me back
come on itll give you a great view its perfect hey
id rather not
no no actually lets make ike the pastor
no you dont you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem you want a man to wake you up at dawn because hes burning to talk to you and he cant wait another minute to find out what youll say am i right
yes i do
no thats called not having a mind of your own what are you doing maggie you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon you dont want to climb annapuma
thats called changing your mind
with the priest you liked them scrambled with the dead head fried with the bug guy poached now its egg whites only thank you very much
what
thats right youre so lost you dont even know how you like your eggs
lost
supportive you werent being supportive you were being scared just like now you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on
every one of those times i was being supportive something you wont understand
or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress
brian told you that
and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai
i already explained about that
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo
that was very interesting research george was doing
or the sexual habits of locusts
its fun its high
well they should because theyre about to watch you hang yourself again
i had it under control now they feel sorry for me
no maggie i defended you humiliating you is what everyone else is doing its the theme of this party
you humiliated me
im the only goddamn person in there pulling for you
i dont and i dont think you should
yes
are you all right with this you think this is funny
excuse me
i dont know give me a minute are you all right with this
missed me bad huh
where did you disappear to
yes it is and it doesnt mean anything
no but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness attraction is very misleading and if its mutual its well terribly distracting
yeah its kind of nice
kind of isolated
wrenches my dads gonna love that one
of what
first i have to find some tools i need a half and a ninesixtenth
can you fix it
your filters clogged this takes unleaded
why dont you let him sleep it off in the trunk ill take you for a ride then well come back for him keep an eye on him
watch your leg dad im so tired of this
no im cleaning an attic i wouldnt attempt the impossible
hmmm figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album youre not trying to soften me up are you
no you take it
its valuable hang onto it
it was in the attic it was jus sitting there gathering dust
oh my god its miles davis this is king of blue this is the original recording hard to find in good condition where did you find this
gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss
ike hi grandma
you know theres no
tell me when you get to the altar will you spike the bouquet
what was that i cant order my eggs without sarcasm
of course
ill have the same
bob will be very happy
fine the newspapers upside down thats better than fine
you look uh you look fine
agreed
even with everything thats happened ive still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress
maybe you should ask her some time ever thought of that
no
you dont know
i dont know
now thats romantic a proposal like that and you didnt find eternal bliss what went wrong
no i think i said something eloquent like so uh maybe we should ya know what do you think
so is that what you said to her
im a work in progress
maybe its just me but if you got to dress it up it doesnt ring true
what do you mean it was incredibly romantic
highly suspect
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life cal ripken even applauded
hes an entomologist i thought it was very unique
its a little silence of the lambs for me i cant believe you waited for the wedding to run
still sweet
always a mood killer
what an incredible chauvinistic observation
well im impressed absolutely incredible i didnt expect pink and lacy but this isnt exactly a womans room
no im not afraid just maybe someday
you afraid to try
maybe someday
i like it this whole thing is pretty incredible i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york
i think so
cindy the manicurist
its a birthday present for my cousin put your finger in
done
sixfifty
five hundred
sevenfifty
too much
because i think youre writing on spec and with a first person interview you might actually sell that thing
youve seen the postits ive already got more juicy material than i need why should i pay you dollar one
oh but making up the facts as you go along is ethical actually i meant you you probably got severance or expenses or both ill take your check no credit cards
my magazine doesnt pay because for stories its not what you call ethical
really
my point is that one again youre getting it all wrong that wont improve your reputation any and its not very flattering to me either so im going to give you a chance to write the truth
im not a boastful man whats your point
youre welcome your notes made interesting bedtime reading if you like trashy fiction your observations are distorted ungrounded an incomplete you must be very proud
how do i do it im not that beautiful
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers
obviously im not the only one who doesnt understand it the uss maggie leaves quite a wake excuse me
you misinterpret everything weve all been friends our whole lives but thats the types of relationship you wouldnt understand
you can turn that finger around
youve been here for three minutes what did you do to her
he is not
look look man i think the man is heartbroken
but the most interesting thing here is that i dont see the rose tattoo that ive heard about on your back
give me that
a prewedding luau
grandma made me the cutest outfit i cant wait to show it to you
nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak
we think so
how romantic
without oxygen
really
twice
everest is that right
despite what you think i dont do it on purpose and i have no intention of doing it again
thats fair
id love to stay and chat but ive got to get back to work i still have my job
well see
youre going to be very disappointed
yes conviction conviction that im onto the truth youre going to do the same thing to poor bastard number four that you did to the last three youre going to run again and im not leaving until you do
did something happen to make you care about reality
you have one
im not here to make you feel bad im here for vindication in my heart
yes
weird dreams youre going to tell me about them
nervous not at all no ive never been more certain in my life except i am having all kinds of weird dreams
getting nervous
youll answer my questions
well instead of a haircut how about a wash you know get all that city grit out of it
excellent
originality is my speciality
i hope you have a different angle its pretty much all been covered
look
what
oh
yes some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony
you okay
i think thats what im saying
oh walter i dont deserve you

im not at the top of the empire state building im here
at the top of the empire state building
i told you nothing
so what happened
yes but it wasnt really it was just
it was a betrayal
i dont know what to say about it walter it was a form of temporary insanity but i had to tell you about it because
walter theres something i have to tell you
beautiful view isnt it
its so beautiful its just what i would have picked out if id had every ring in the world to choose from you see what i mean there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises but i am not one of them surprises are highly overrated

grace the dispatcher great
grace heard it

dad i was talking to jessica about reincarnation and she thinks that probably you knew annie in another life
victoria shes okay
god shes beautiful
im never going to meet anyone whos going to measure up to your mom in your eyes what do you think theres a perfect woman walking around out there
was mom an adjustment
jonah this isnt fair you dont know victoria i hardly know her myself she is in fact a mystery to me she tosses her hair a lot why does she do this i have no idea is it a twitch does she need a haircut should she use barrette so it doesnt keep falling in her face these are things that im willing to get to the bottom of and that is why i am dating her that is all i am doing i am not marrying her can you appreciate the difference thats what single people do they try people on and they see if they fit but nobody fits perfectly everyone is an adjustment
if she knew shed never forgive me it would be hopeless for the two of you
this is not a joke thank god victoria doesnt know it would really have hurt her feelings
its a short word
long enough to call victoria a ho
i just called for a second
everyone at work heard you
no
did you call that radio station again
thats true why is that
the water tastes better in the kitchen
theres a bathroom upstairs
i was thirsty
what are you doing up

thank victoria for dinner

she doesnt want us to go to baltimore she wants to meet us in new york city on valentines day on top of the empire state building
here is seattle and here is baltimore case closed

i uh have a date with someone friday night
i know but shes here jonah because i have you and as long as i have you i have your mom
im starting to forget her
i never did or the whole idea of an afterlife but i dont know any more i have these dreams about your mom and we have long talks about about you and how you are which she sort of knows but i tell her anyway so what is that its sort of an afterlife isnt it
like do you believe in heaven
i dont know
i miss her what do you think happens to someone after they die
is that what she used to sing
bye bye blackbird
youre worried were going to be all right were going to be all right i remember sometimes youd have nightmares as a baby your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song
our house there was water coming in all the windows
what was
it was sinking
how do you know
i know
dad this is amazing if you play this backwards it says paul is dead
its nice to meet you jessica
hi dad dad this is jessica
go to sleep
jeds got cables
whose show was this on
in the movies women are always scratching up guys back and screaming and stuff when theyre having sex
what
will she scratch up your back
what do you think
if you get a new wife i guess youll have sex with her huh
im starting to notice that
it doesnt they ask you
but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time youre halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if its just a drink if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you dont you can go home if you see what i mean i wonder if it still works this way
a slice of pizza
you see someone you like you get a feeling about them you ask them if they want to have a drink or
english muffin how do you do it
this is not how you do it you want this on an english muffin or a bun
dad youre not taking this seriously
she looks like my third grade teacher i hated my third grade teacher hold it wait a minute she uisu my third grade teacher
shes willing to fly anywhere
im not going to think about what theyre not teaching you in school i am not going to think about it generally speaking i think we should rule out people who dont live somewhere near here
somewhere in the middle
oklahoma do you know where that is
this is no good shes looking for someone french or greek dear sleepless in seattle i live in tulsa where is that
thank god something you dont know its a single white female
dear sleepless in seattle i am an swf what is that
you have to give them your phone number or they wont let you go on the air
how did they get our phone number

and buys a deadly poison he enters the tomb to say farewell to juliet who lies there cold as death he drinks the poison he dies by her side and then she wakes and sees him dead
thats me
i have not said all by malign fate the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friars plan he hears only that juliet is dead and thus he goes to the apothecary
by heaven i thank you i will be your apothecary
mr fennyman because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play i am writing an apothecary a small but vital role
of course it was mighty writing there is no one like marlowe
yes i saw it
i saw his tamburlaine you know wonderful
who is that
gentlemen thank you you are welcome
sad and wonderful i have a blue velvet cap which will do well i have seen apothecary with a cap just so
well that will have them rolling in the aisles
the apothecary will what is the story where is the shipwreck how does the comedy end
mr shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary
henslowe you pound of tripe in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage so dont tell me about business

how
nothing strangely enough it all turns out well
so what do we do
mr fennyman let me explain about the theatre business the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster believe me to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre
by order of the master of the revels
oh that
the theatres are all closed by the plague
what have i done mr fennyman
this time we take your boots off
without doubt he is completing it at this very moment
romeo and ethel the pirates daughteralmost finished

of course not
theres never any
a share of the profits
but i have to pay the actors and the authors
good title

as stories must when loves deniedwith tears and a journey those whom god has joined in marriage not even i can put asunder
indeed i am a bride short how is this to end

your majesty
there was a wager i rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love i think you lost it today you are an eager boy did you like the play
your majesty
i would have made you immortal tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare

mr pope mr phillips welcome george bryan james armitage sam my pretty one are you ready to fall in love again

oh what is your name
i like it when they cut heads off and the daughter mutilated with knives
you admire it

better fortune boy
ill be damned if you are
i am ethel sir the pirates daughter
who are you master
write me well
good bye my love a thousand times good bye
nor you for me
you will never age for me nor fade nor die
i dont know its a mystery
how does it
but all ends well
and thus unable to declare her love
but fearful of her virtue she comes to him dressed as a boy
orsinogood name
at sea thena voyage to a new worldshe lands upon a vast and empty shore she is brought to the dukeorsino
sold in marriage and half way to america
an excellent beginning let him bea duke and your heroine
a comedy what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom sick with love
the queen commands a comedy will for twelfth night
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more then i shall be the sorrier
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it
it was we ourselves did that and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise
i am done with theatre the playhouse is for dreamers look where the dream has brought us
a hired player no longer fifty pounds will for the poet of true love
i have more care to stay than will to go come death and welcome juliet wills it so how ist my soul lets talk it is not day
thou needst not to be gone
it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east nights candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops i must be gone and live or stay and die
wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree believe me love it was the nightingale
will you read it for me
but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows as solemn as they are unsanctified
nono
if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare
you cannot marry wessex
you were not dead before when i thought you dead i did not care about all the plays that will never come only that i would never see your face i saw our end and it will come
oh my love you ran from me before
i love you will beyond poetry
i was the more deceived
calf love i loved the writer and gave up the prize for a sonnet
my love is no lie i have a wife yes and i cannot marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that and yet you let me come to your bed
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed
you lie
he was not dead before i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come
you never spoke so well of him
marlowes touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations
a literary feud quite normal
will what
stage fighting oh will as thomas kent my heart belongs to you but as viola the river divides us and i will marry wessex a week from saturday
i know how to fight
you cannot wessex will kill you
then i will go with you
you follow your desire freely enough in the night so if that is all to greenwich i go
to be the wife of a poor playercan i wish that for lady viola except in my dreams and yet i would if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day
what will you have me do marry you instead
you cannot not for the queen herself
yes this is not life will this is a stolen season
in heaven perhaps it is not a comedy i am writing now a broad river divides my loversfamily duty fateas unchangeable as nature
oh but it will end well for love
i found something in my sleep the friar who married them will take up their destinies
oh but it is mine too
thats my line
good night good night as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
yes some of it is speakable
oh will
i must i must
oh do not go
it was the owl believe me love it was the owl
it is broad day the rooster tells us so
there is time it is still dark
ohno no
let him be damned for his pages
mr henslowe
oh let henslowe wait
it was the owlcome to bed
no the morning rooster woke me
moonlight
i must look how pale the window
you would not leave me
well perhaps better than my first
and that was only my first try
oh
even your play
there is
i would not have thought it there is something better than a play
it is strange to me too
i do not know how to undress a man
then kiss me again for i am not mistook
i am
answer me only this are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare
wait you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent
can you love a player
can you love a fool
oh not for the world
you can bring them with a word
if they find you here they will kill you
oh my lady my love
ohi am him too
alas indeed for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart
a lowly player
oh but why alas
the same alas
anon good nurse anon master shakespeare
will shakespeare
who is there
my lady
killed last night in a tavern come then well say a prayer for his soul
he is dead
ohdear god i did not think it would be me to tell you a great loss to playwriting and to dancing
mourning who is dead my lord
and on a day of mourning i never met the fellow but once at your house
it is to be expected on a sunday
i understand of course it is to be expected
i am going to church
bless me i thought it was a horse
it is not my riding day my lord
you look sad my lady let me take you riding
lady viola isyoung in the world your majesty is wise in it nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting ill wager my fortune
i meanyour majesty they do not they have not but i believe there is one who can
ah my lady the tide waits for no man but i swear it would wait for you
good morning my lord
i will do my duty my lord
she wants to inspect you at greenwich come sunday be submissive modest grateful and brief
the queen has consented
will you defy your father and your queen
it was your eyes no your lips
but why me
why yes my fortune lies in my plantations the tobacco weed i need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to worki fancy tobacco has a future we will not stay there long three or four years
virginia
how your mind hops about your father was a shopkeeper your children will bear arms and i will recover my fortune that is the only matter under discussion today you will like virginia
i do not love you my lord
your father should keep you better informed he has bought me for you he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday you are allowed to show your pleasure
do you intend to marry my lord
no i have spoken to the queen her majestys consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife and once gained her consent is her command
you flatter my lord
i am aware of it but it is beautys privilege
lord wessex you have been waiting
my lady viola
so my lord i speak with him every day
i have spoken with your father
my lord
my lady viola
it is thomas but of good reputation come there is no harm in a drink
ohitsitsoh its a house of ill repute
for one kiss i would defy a thousand wessexes
but what of lord wessex
yes by god love knows nothing of rank or riverbank it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king and their love should be minded by each for love denied blights the soul we owe to god so tell my lady william shakespeare waits for her in the garden
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance for what lady could live up to it close to when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine besides can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player
oh thomas a pair of pippins as round and rare as golden apples
what of her bosom
constantly without doubt and plays the lute she has a natural ear and her bosomdid i mention her bosom
she sings too
deeper softer none of your twittering larks i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song
and her voice like lark song
oh thomas her lips the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy
and her lips
oh if i could write the beauty of her eyes i was born to look in them and know myself
yes like rain and sun like cold and heat is your lady beautiful since i came to visit from the country i have not seen her close tell me is she beautiful
like a sickness and its cure together
yes my aunt but perhaps she wept a little tell me how you love her will
your aunt
i her letter came to me by the nurse
no and yet she does where the ink has run with tears was she weeping when she gave you this
does she say so
she loves me thomas
it is only ours you can know
and break her heart and mine
if you love her you must do what she asks
she tells me to keep away she is to marry lord wessex what should i do
of course you have not i have not written it
i am very sorry sir i have not seen act two
he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet
no sir
do you understand me
yes sir
let me see you take off your hat
are you mr shakespeare
wait there
i
where did you learn how to do that
my hat
take off your hat
thomas kent i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player

oh i dont know
jackie really shouldnt drink
george is a hairdresser isnt he
that bastard

listen i wonder if you kids could give me a ride im kind of stranded here
oh thats no problem take care of this boys problem will you gene
his car they have it blocked
whats the problem honey
well thats wonderful ill stop by there for a drink
well wed love to but were going to another party
oh say how would you kids like to stop off for a drink
where to les
call me les
terrific now all i have to do is find my car keys
everything okay son
were going to be here all night
no of course not
everybody but us
have they sat down
i think theyre waiting for somebody to start dinner
or from the cut on his hand which is more probable
im a hemotologist not a detective
with no bone or scalp or hair present would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a mans skull
you dont
i dont know
im a hemotologist sir i was asked only t
well if the blood got uontou the gaff by crushing a mans skull
none
no bits of bone no particles of scalp no strands of hair
bits of blood and wood what else would there be
you scraped the dried blood from the ubuttu of the gaff where a fellas uhandu goes and what did you see under your microscope besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings
thats obvious
and the blood could unotu have belonged to defendant seeing that his type is o negative
no but as i say the type is rare ten percent of caucasian males
but you cant say with any certainty that the blood was his
carl heines type
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all it was uhumanu yes type b positive
did he see some udangeru from defen
that hed keep an eye on miyamoto watch out for him
when your son came back from the war what did he say about all this
well every time i see him in town or somewhere hes starin at me with these narrow eyes givin me his mean face
what do you mean by dirty looks
just showed up at my door big as life and twice as mean wanted to talk to my son
and when he came home did he write you about this or phone perhaps
in the war europe i believe they could hardly send him to the pacific could they
now defendants father had also died by that point where was the defendant when you sent his family their equity
their kids was born here so when the oldest that one there was twentylast payment gets made and he could own it
why if they could never take title
carl held it uforu em called it a lease they make payments every june and december
but back in japaneseborn could not uownu land so
they fished tgether went to school carl junior treated him like a white person like any friend
so the defendant knew the deceased your son even then
him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land lived in a pickers cabin at first
you done your math right
it is
is that your third question
so that makes what would have been into doesnt it if you sent the equity back you had a profit of
a thousand
second question what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre
tried to defaulted on their payments
just three questions the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for
well it does seem mighty warm in here specially for mr hooks
thank you mr gillanders thank you for coming down in this cold weather
now how is miyamoto gonna know in uadvanceu that carl loses two batteries must happen once ever years or so
well what if
you mean miyamoto followed him out there and suckerpunched him
all right what if the defendant uheardu so carl uletu him aboard to help and uthenu the fishing gaff
compressed air horn most likely hope to god some man hears you in that fog
course if carl lost both batteries dead in the water his radio wouldnt work so how would he signal for help
boat has two batteries lose one you run off the other til morning carl musta lost both so miyamoto there gave him one a his
no sense to have uanyu at all even the right size its like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car nobody does
now the sheriff believed that the d battery in carls well was carls own spare even though it was too large f
couldnt get on the boat id just ushootu the feller uthenu tie up throw him inta th drink and skip bein the first gillnetter in history to make a successful forced boarding
so the fishing gaff method wouldnt make sense
im sorry about that it wasnt mine in the first place
its a joke maneuver up to carls boat tie your lines fast come aboard all against carls will its the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of
now if you wanted to kill a man think youd try boarding against his will and hitting him with a fishing gaff
unwritten rule of the sea we dont bother each other stick to ourselves ask anybody
now mister gi
i said no further questions
youre implying th
question withdrawn you may step down
it seems human to me
doesnt it seem to uyouu mrs miyamoto that your mistake was in being deceitful concealing information during the course of a sheriffs investigation
well it seems to me
we were afraid silence seemed better to come forward seemed like a mistake
so you hid the truth deliberately
trials arent only about truth mr hooks even though they should be theyre about what people ubelieveu is true
but if truth was on your side whatever were you worried about
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder
why not
we discussed that and decided not to
up in the air was uthatu your reaction
yes and then what was there to call about everything was up in the air
and then something did carl heine was found dead with his head crushed
of course not were just not quick to run and boast in case something went wrong
you thought the deceased might break his promise
so five hours plenty of time for a call he was excited you say in the sense of being overjoyed
closer to eight
your husband returned at what seven oclock
we hear how carlpassed away only a few hours later
so then youand your husband must have called friends relatives to tell them the amazing news yes
happy for him and relieved
you wereoverjoyed yourself to hear the news
i said excited not agitated he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed
its not for the they only get to convict him
i did but the jury wont s
did you write that column
look i uwantu to forget you i do i think if you hold me just this once i can walk away and never speak to you again
you have to hear this i can never touch you ishmael not once not ever theres no half way as much as i know it hurts you you have to let this go
theres no one here and ive ugotu to talk to you
im married ishmael it isnt right for us to be alone people will t
the japs did it
im sorry about your arm kabuo and i are very sor
i couldnt say anything i just stood there hating her
i dont mean everyone just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them or run a newspaper
we all expect the world to be fair as if we have some right t
look at my face its the face of the people who did that my father hardly speaks english were in bad trouble you have to see that
its just pearl harbor people are a little crazy right n
itll be over soon i can get you money
my father cant get our money from the bank we have a few dol
i lie to my parents every day and every night
there cant be any wrong in this ha
well i dont do it for just anybody
i can just feel my spirits soar
why were only talking
my mom would be the problem
were japanese not mexican ishmael hell slice you up with a ceremonial sword
your friends would your dad would kill me with a machete
the best part was that there was a this to debate the wrongness of
easy slow is best
i told myself that was good that it made our friendship special and didnt mean she was ashamed of it necessarily
at school she kept mostly to the japanese kids and sort of ignored me as if all of our times alone togetherin the hollow cedar everywherewere a secret
hes still got a good grip we need to dig more
but he found you
your father fought at belleau wood it took him years to get over it nightmares tears b
those arent the facts that matter
theyre not his neighbor like you are he is a husband a father he risked his ulifeu for utheiru country the same as you
seattle boys think hes guilty they say the evidence is rock solid
they only arrested that poor soul because hes japanese
youve been busy with that trial i suppose such a travesty
i felt milhollands report in my pocket and wondered why i wasnt telling her telling someone what id found
agnostics dont believe or disbelieve ma we just dont pretend we know
you dont believe in god anymore
oh in a heartbeat
and your evaluation of the defendant could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff so quickly there would be no sign of struggle
what else i had the boy teach me kendo includingthe importance of the bow
well what then sergeant
more than eager he was out to make a point
so wide crosssection of men to evaluate and the day that the defendant volunteered for this demonstration did you find him eager
it was my specialty sir i trained several thousand over the years
and you were generally experienced in training men for handtohand combat
they were japaneseamerican boys yes sir
pretty darn clear
and replaced it later with the new one thats your inference
you bet and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off he coulda left this line behind on carls boat
so if defendant had tied up to deceaseds boat with that last one would those cleats have lined up
found on carls boat too starboard side second cleat from the stern but it doesnt match carls lines it matches miyamotos perfect
and the last
from carl heines boat all his were like this one threestrand manila new condition braided in loops not bowlined like miyamotos
and the next one
comes off third cleat from the stern port side and its brand new unlike the rest
these are fishermen alvin they dont talk at all to each other and less to me specially gossip
so noimmediate suspicion nogeneral talk of enmity between the two
nossir id gone to tell the wid to tell mrs heine
and you werent there when the coroner examined the wound
japanese stickfighting theyre trained as kids yknow to kill with sticks
could you tell me what kendo is
well i was a doctor in the jap theater in the war i saw those kendo wounds umanyu times looked exactly like this one
and why is that
i said that if i was playing sherlock holmesid maybe look for a japanese person with a bloody gun butt a righthanded fella to be precise
did you say more
he said could it be somebody hit him and i said you want to play sherlock holmes here
so when the sheriff returned you showed him the injury to the deceaseds head
tht was summation your h
your honor uallu of this is speculation including mr hooks dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call
objection
youre a hard man to trust sir you sit before us with no expression keeping a poker f
all right what did your son usayu to that effect
objection asking witness to speculate about deceaseds state of mind
my gosh alvin was i supposed to object every time you did that
objection asking the witness to speculate
as peculiar as a struggle between a pound man and an assailant strong enough to subdue himthat leaves only a usingleu overturned ucupu in its wake
no sir i cant not beyond a reasonable doubt
uwereu you sir can you uproveu one word of all your fancy story
thats curious i was uappealingu to their intelligence
and i wouldnt blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful at a tactic that insults their intelligence
thats how journalists answer questions
i asked you a question youre writing a tract h
he didnt want to lose any more
greedy
like you couldnt believe
your line of work you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth
oh yes
but isnt the utruthu that there are useveralu other ways to explain ueachu of these twelve pieces
then putting them together so truth is revealed
my expertise is that im a journalist
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork what is your expertise sir are you a detective of sorts
twelve
well the freighter the twine the blood the knife the cup the watch the second battery the phantom lantern the fishing gaff the cracked gunnel the skull wound the blond hair thats uelevenu things
im sorry was there a question in there
ueverythingu had to happen ujustu right for your little story to fly i mean a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a ulotu of reasons
objection speculation
maybe it went where carl went over the side
he said he didnt want that life no more hed been saving to buy a farm he was sorry i got sick but pretty excited to get back his fathers place
but carl was a fisherman and successful at it
carl heine came
and then your stroke came this summer and you put your property on the market i believe you said september which remember is ueightu days before carl heine died and who comes spetember wanting to buy
oh yeh but this is nine year ago i had my healt i wasnt wantin to sell
mr jurgensen did he offer to ubuyu the seven acres from you
oh yeh he said someday he would get his land back
robbed he was angry
i had a spare battery in my shed i brought it down and put it in just before the sheriff showed up
well the sheriff found utwou batteries in your well if you left one with carl heine how is that possible
yes
didnt go anywhere else no errands no purchases just straight to the boat thats the truth
i slept til onethirty when my wife woke me up with the news we talked for a few hours i left at six and went straight to my boat
i see now what happened the day carl heine was found before your arrest
you mean this morning the new story the battery story that one is the truth thats a question sir
i have told the truth
my apologies do you regret not telling the truth
should have told everything meaning you should have told the utruthu
i should have told everything right away i know that now and i regret it
well initially is an interesting word sir youd ubeenu arrested you uhadu a lawyer and you ustillu claimed ignorance
yes initially
but even uafteru you had an attorney you still claimed to know unothingu claimed unotu to have seen carl am i correct
sheriff said right off i was under suspicion i didnt have a lawyer
actually she said you had decided decided unotu not come forward
as my wife testified we were considering it
some seamans loast report stuffed in a cabinet good as lost forever no one knows
they got transferred that day out to cape flattery
no night of the th morning the th we replaced two guys named miller and milholland
you mean early morning the th
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september
how long you have this detail
shorthard the radio transmis sions write em up file em in a cabinet nobody ever looks just take up space
and you keep the records or contribute to em
since september last guys got transferred
you have the night watch on the radio
dont prove there was two lanterns coulda been the one in the cabin
its on the twine too but its not r
youre right i better use two
you gonna climb that with one arm
have a look at nothing
here now what are you fixin to do
its public record if the public cares enough to read it
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place
wont take two
you said three minutes
three kids whats she going to do
i did boy
its a rare thing takes a turning point
we dont let go you s
naw ive seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes
you ever been strangled by a single hand
if i whistle those boysll see you and come runnin uyoureu the story today
ill take two one for later
cigarette
well anything coulda caused that
the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel just below the mast
you think so
he hit his head on the way in
still and all carl was a strong swimmer he m
the freighter started through at the sea water seeped into carls watch and stopped it at
still a coincidence timing and all
the knife what knife
then wheres the lantern and wheres the knife
but you ucouldu be wrong he ucouldu have climbed up earlier
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio which is now working same report milholland heard and uthatu makes him get the lantern fast before the freighters wake can bang it around
maybe
coincidences happen you run a yellow light ujustu as a car comes out of nowhere splitsecond tragedy happens every day or maybe
just as the freighter comes through isnt that quite a coincidence
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there so he climbs up to cut it down
still lashed to the mast
miyamoto gave him the battery and left carls boat was running he goes back to fishing but at some point he thinks of the lantern
fell
thats when he fell
because the second lantern the one on the mast was never found so we have to ask
well why does it
thats what mr miyamoto reported and hed have no reason to lie he couldnt know that it would help his case
now you believe there were utwou lanterns when defendant arrived one in carls hand the second lashed to the mast
well it shows the prosecutor was wrong it was ucarlsu boat that was dead in the water or hed never have put up the lantern
tell us why that lantern would be so significant
to my father everything counts
hes looking down and hes not thinking bout the man you were yesterday hes proud of the man you are tonight thats what counts
yes he was
your daddy was quite a feller
im wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones in the middle of the night
youre wondering why i held it
this tastes horrible hmmn
no you dont
its the way it happened i know it is
look no way im lettin you out there in a half hour you could be in canada
sheriff i cant afford not to fish toni
sure blood gets all uoveru your hand sheriff ask any fisherman
you gaff with the uhooku end bloods on the butt where your hand goes
sure you did help me with this hold cover willya
naw i had that around for a while
see you replaced a mooring line lately this ones new
i was checking the cables
you always run with the well open
we have a warrant to search your boat
what for sheriff
and what do you believe
i told your wife trials arent always so much about actual truth as about what folks ubelieveu is true thats sad and its real
you think that uisu the truth
i want you to tell the truth
you want me to say that
you wont hear that from hooks because the charge is ufirstudegree murder which requires premeditation he cant change the charge
im more a hotblooded killer huh like a soldier like a samurai
that you came upon carl by accident like you said gave him the battery like you said asked him about the seven acres like you said
and whats that
i should show them an american
so every time you think about showing that jury strength or honor or composure or dignity
mr gudmundsson we uknowu what that jury is looking at
now this jury is gonna be lookin at the evidence with one eye and at you with the oth
youre wonderinhow come i never ask if you did it
you wouldnt even see it move
sure i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open right above your left ear
bet theres a few things you could teach me kendo for one
i think you like learning
you must think i like losing
you mean do i like to take the offensive or hang back and wait
white or black
your daddy played i asked down at the japanese community center you smoke cigars
what makes you think i play
uyouu said that that was uyouru testimony
even though a d is too big and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in which makes it a peculiar choice for a spare
what else could it be
which you inferred was replaced by the d which must have been a spare
one d and one d in the well and a dead d on the deck
the damage was considerable but shes insured thanks again
and her farmhouse
shes alright nels thanks for asking
how uisu your motherinlaw
possible but not darn likely
operating this winch youd rarely operated before doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of poundsis it upossibleu possible that he struck his head uafteru death possible
you dont urememberu
he was heavy but we were real careful but i dont remember him hitting anything anywhere
you dont uthinku so
i dont think so
is it possible his head struck the transom or the stern gunnel or the net roller as you were bringing him in
now youve testified that the deceased was a heavy man and hard to bring out of the net
i believe so
im curious the d that was refitted into the deceaseds well was it exactly the same brand and model as defendants
apparently
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with unou spare battery hmmn
no
no spare
two ds thats the kind his well was fitted for
sheriff how many batteries and what size did you find on udefendantsu boat
it was dead we had it tested maybe the d was the spare and he had to use it
but he had a spare d you said right there why not use that
hes done some onthespot refit ting you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery a d is one inch wider than a d it would be too large for the deceaseds well
it is
you found three batteries you say a d and d in the well and a spare d on the cabin floor correct
you have to wonder
a little yes you have to wonder
does it now
didnt think about it at the time so no it didnt strike me odd
and yet you started the engine right up with all those lights drawing all night the batteries had that much charge did that strike you odd
yessir thered been real heavy fog
i think you testified uallu the lights were on cabin mast net lights picking lights
maybe
right in the middle of the floor
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin and forgot the cup
uyesu im sure
are you absol
absolutely not probably one or two hours four at the most
yes you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceaseds right hand the report says recent origin how recent as much as hours before death
can i say something here
for the third time yes
but you are ucertainu that he died by drowning
for certain no
uandu that you cant say for ucertainu whether the head injury was sustained before or uafteru death
i already said that b
is it fair to say that you do not know for ucertainu which it was
sure anythings poss
is it possible
if the head was moving fast enough but i dont see how it could be
so if his head struck something narrow and flat the gunnel of a boat a net roller a fairlead could that have
the same
can you tell whether an object moved against the head or the other way around or would both look the same
obviously
in your motorcycle example those injuries are produced by the head being propelled uagainstu an object rather than the reverse yes
your report says death by udrowningu which means he went into the water alive and breathing and the report is accurate
well
meaning that he wasnt murdered first say on the deck of the boat and then thrown overboard
thats uwhyu the autopsy report identifies udrowningu as the cause of death
as i testified it occurs when water mucus and air are mixed by respiration i believe i said that
so thisfoam you found in the lungs how does it get there
thats all he said
the question is more about the udefendantsu attitu
carl said he didnt like kabuo much anymore
sorry about that mrs heine shall i repeat the ques
you can speak for what he usaidu just like you did for mr hooks
i cant speak for him
carl ever say uheu got one
he had no reason to
those dirty looks defendant ever aim one of those at you
of course not but it was emotional a friends plea set against his mothers attitude
carl never lied
i guess youd have to guess not having been there with them having to guess whether your husbands report was word for word accurate
so the defendant was encouraged to hope or could have been
not in those words
well he didnt say no did he didnt say no hope existed
i wouldnt say encouraged
so your husband said hes think it over encouraged mr miyamoto to believe he might sell to h
and she wonders why i swim to the bottom of a lemondrop every time i see her
or kat
if ed ever found out
still
it was such a long time ago

seven if you count the onandoff years which i do
you were so good to me i swear i never meant to hurt you we were together what five years

youre judging me oh thats a good one youre lying to me youre lying to your family and youre lying to yourself but youre going to stand there and point a finger at me the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend
you let me make a fool of myself you lied to me i dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do its your job its who you are how would you even know if something were real

spontaneously combust
what would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think
make out with you for free
what would you do if you werent an escort
desperation
there was something in your voice on the phone that day
so whyd you say yes to me
when i said id never done a wedding before i didnt say that no one ever asked i just never said yes
sure but its never easy they say theyre okay with it and they arefor a while then one day theyre not

you paid me for a lot of reasons closure wasnt one of them
he was about to unstick me i paid you to help me get closure
i just hate seeing you so stuck
oh cut the crap
hello goodbye i want you i hate you its all just words none of it means anything what matters is what you do you either stay put or you walk away if you look back youre not walking away
yup thats why you get to keep your money
but nothing did
believe me if anything had happened that would have been one of the highlights for you
what
no no the three hundred is for you doing it to me
and what if i didnt want you toto do that to me
not dollars pounds
so youre telling me if something had happened last nightit would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars thats a down payment on a ford focus
not if you take an advance on your credit card
dont they have a limit at those machines
if i was going to charge you i would have told you beforehand i thought i explained that
of course not howhow could it be nothing happened
is this for last night
we kissed made out a little then you passed out
are you sure
ive got this bad taste in my mouth what is it i think its the words morally repugnant
come on
show me
its hard to explain
i disappear its not about me
subtle
oh come on youre like the yoda of escorts
i swear i dont have a signature move
okay
dont stop asking questions okay
this is awkward for me talking about it makes me feel better
i love that youre asking questions but do you really want to get into all of this
my sixthgrade science project was entitled love hurts the heartbreak of human papillomavirus trust me im careful
theres a guy on st and madison you get your results in hours do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them
what do you think
i guess so
are you asking me if im gay for pay
when youre ready to let go to be unsingle and unmiserable you will until then
what
yes
first of all its never out of the blue and second of all
sowhat was ioh yeah do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then out of the blue shattered my heart
admit it you were disturbed but ultimately moved
and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries
i have a different story for every woman who asks i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me
you shit
yeah as an adult i needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex but with rules that couldnt be violated
oh no
the real story is that my mother was a hippie and a stripper she was insanely inappropriate with me she used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater while i was still in the bath
shampoo got it
would you grab my shampoo
if it makes you feel any better to get your number i had to cough up two roundtrip tickets to amsterdam and a case of minibaileys
your friend guaranteed my anonymity
i have a friend at the magazine
how did you know that was me
well happen in the sense that i picked up the phone tracked you down flew you here and gave you six grand out of my k
this happened to you
sorry im a little nervous i never thought something like this would happen to me
thats right imagine facing it alone
not you youre not disgusting youre lovely just the idea that theyd bring an escort i mean a stranger who um didntwho never i mean someones dead
i think thats disgusting
not the way youre thinking the women wanted me there for support you can understand that
a wedding

graham russell and russell hitchcock
who are they
im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality except for approval that i cant get enough of
you quitting
its okay hell ive never paid for it but please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me
that wont be an issue believe me i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant no offense
great with the occasional stabs of shame now listen this covers the weekend but as we discussed if you want to be intimate we talk money before anything happens
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you
on the nose i tell you what because youre so cute ill take care of our incidentals
six thousand right

kat
hi hey

hey sigmund you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party
and the ass of the man who adores her
best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them
what do you say to that
what would you say if i told you i was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource your daughter

i dont know just a fin over there about a hundred meters
a shark fin
a fin

richard i saw a fin

everyone ok
i have no idea but it looks like a long way
so how many miles do you think it is
we think in miles not kilometers
so
i dont know im american
yeah ok forget it we wont tell anyone
richard its secret thats the whole point
were going to swim one or two kilometers across open sea from one uninhabited island to another something goes wrong what then
why
oh great not far at all i dont like to be negative but do you think we should let someone know where were going
one or two kilometers
yes of course i can swim how far do you think it is
thats the wrong one
he will not take us to the island its in the national park and it is forbidden to go there but we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night
there is one problem
nice work
its arranged tomorrow morning eight hundred bath
of course but look all these people if that place existed theyd all be there
it would be nice though if there was a place like that you know that no one could get to
we moved rooms because of him
oh that noise yes he certainly did
she means your neighbor the scotsman
the noise dont worry youre on holiday
good morning
bonjour
if its too far then well drown but if we dont try then well never know
too far
its just the sky richard
sorry i thought i was doing quite well
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them
richard you know something
exactly
so on one you are rich on another poor on one you are a murderer on another the victim
there are infinite worlds out there where anything that can happen does happen

because pasta should be eaten al dente so the trinket will just have to wait a bit
tell me why dont you go and get your medal
look at me these arent lungs these are tanks how long can you hold your breath
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it
as i said second of all youre too skinny youve got tiny lungs i still dont understand how you can dive without getting sick
two years younger than you
if we dont im going to beat you
why
well about everything
everything about what
everything
no it depends sometimes they are what exactly do you want to know

you dont have a room paolo what did i just hear i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger
i dont have one
what room have you got
i remember hi roberto
thats too easy every time i beat a record theres always some dumbshit asking me dyou know that french guy mayol hes supposed to be very good too bad he doesnt compete so youre going to come with me to taormina first because youre my friend and second because you dont have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure ill see you there
youre the best enzo
no all you need is to want to be the best
i dont want to be in any competition i dive because i like to not to beat a record dont you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him

they say im like lazarus you know the guy who was raised from the dead

fine
well if it isnt the little frenchman how is the little frenchman
promise you wont forget me
anything
promise me one thing
you are the father
thats good thats wonderful its wonderful for you
jacques im pregnant
i saw how it has to be
youve got to tell me what happened
because you have to find a good reason to come back up again and i always have a hard time finding one
why
the feeling of slipping without falling the hardest is once you are at the bottom
when you dive with that machine what does it feel like
no ill be fine can you just hand me a glass of water
you want to lie down for a while
its nothing just the long trip im a little jetlagged
whats wrong
you go back ill walk
jacques
im putting you on the coin your essence that way youll always be with me when i dive
what are you doing
nothing
what
i dont know it didnt feel right im going to bed im tired
youll try again tomorrow
i didnt dive
and you
im very pleased to meet you uncle louis
uncle louis hes a year old amazing guy isnt he
bonjour monsieur louis
youll understand
why did you take me to the hotel if you live here
okay in that case im at the airport in nice
absolutely positive
you sure
not at all
im being a pain huh
its me again
hello
you go down to the bottom of the sea where the water isnt even blue anymore where the sky is only a memory and you float there quietly quietly and stay there and you decide that you will die for them only then do they start coming out they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them if its sincere if its pure they will be with you and take you away forever
no tell me
do you know how it is do you know what youre supposed to do to meet a mermaid
uh ah a story
then tell me a story
its hard you know youre so far away and i dont know what else to say
well then talk to me some more
im still here
so have i hello
thats funny i had this job with enzo we got fired too
i got fired
how are you
its me johana
hello
but its not true i feel good with you it feels right
yes you do you know exactly what im talking about youre afraid i want to hold onto you and i do but youre not ready at least not for me
im not from the sea i dont understand what youre talking about
because one shouldnt fall in love with creatures from the sea
why
im going back home
arent you happy dont you feel proud i feel proud and all i did was watch
i did
jacques you set a world record
uh yes of course
can i come watch you dive tomorrow
i dont know i just feel it
how do you know that

the way she moves
how can you tell its a female
no huh yes of course
no
you you wouldnt want to spend the day with me
id better get back now
im glad you stayed thank you
just checking up on your family i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress well
give it to me
well water isnt exactly the best thing for pictures not even for pictures of dolphins
no i want to show you is it ruined
my wallet
only to help the medics i assure you
you jumped in
lucky i was there to save you
please move slowly youre rocking the boat
especially the sneakers
thank you
you look adorable
its too loud for me
i thought youd be at the dinner
maybe on earth there is one but not when you dive you see to dive deep into the sea for no reason just to do it its a feeling i dont know how to say this voluptuous
i guess but you know im american and ive mostly been taught to be competitive theres always pleasure of being the best
yes maybe i dont know i dont like competitions it ruins the fun dont you think
just because i would have liked to visit the town see the coast i dont know anybody expect for you
i dont know why
youre going to be very busy these days arent you
im being a pain in the ass its beautiful here
i thought it was a nice place isnt it
thanks for helping with the bag it looks great
okay ill try
no no youll like it its superb
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo i work for an insurance company so i decided to take a few days off i dont know this island at all it really is gorgeous
but what brought you to sicily

please have a seat
no in the hut
in the lake

no no johana is visiting me
are you crazy i have no use for a woman since my accident
i brought johana to meet you
did you buy the cassettes the wagner the berlioz
uncle louis this is my friend johana
assassin
where i saw the mermaids why dont you ever ask any question im always the one asking the question were sitting here like two stones and im taking to myself ask me something goddamnit
what
why dont you ask me
no
hey have you ever seen a mermaid
then you shouldnt eat everyday jacques
you shouldnt dive everyday papa
you a tourist
haha yeah what about that road back there though it says closed to the public doesnt it
maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the getty museum
nobody huh how come
aint nobody out there mister
all those soldiers out there getting bored thirsty come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps
must it
hot these roads all round here closed to the public whys that military bases huh i guess theres space enough for war games must be good for business
dial ooo on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink sir
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard eh her brothers death
no thank you ill be fine
you will have to ask mr de moraes that sir would you like a drink while you wait
you wouldnt recall if the brothersinlaw left together would you
i work here sir im here most of the time
by the way laurence were you here last time your mistresss brother came over you know just before he disappeared
mr de moraes is due back from brazil late this evening mrs de moraes is out and not expected before eight do you wish
when will they be back
im afraid they are out at the moment sir
could i speak to carlos or deborah
good afternoon de moraess residence
that would be mrs de moraes mother sir mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter
de moraes i was asked here by a mrs spitz
i am lawrence sir mr and mrs de moraes majordomo they are expecting you
that might depend on where youre going
will you please come with me
thats right
the dead can wait
i we have to bury leon tommorrow
you wouldnt understand
why the hell couldnt you divorce the man
your parents arranged the visit to my office
i dont know everyones dead
what do you suggest
on once once what are we you going to do
so you did talk about it huh
my parents flew back from israel told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce he flew back to brazil and his drowning was arranged
get to the point will you
the staff dont know yet i called my parents told them everything i just couldnt take any more
your flunkey said he was expected back tonight
they found his body yesterday in the pool at our house in sao paulo he drowned drank too much went for a swim and drowned
no not us
we you and your parents killed your husband
do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother
he he is dead my husband is dead call my parents theyll tell you call them
do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser deborah and then your brothers not buried yet as i said earlier an autopsy will
what are you doing you cant i
you know something ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time id hoped to have a private word with adonis but if thats the way you want it
perhaps i did until fear turned into panic thats when he hit me and told me hed killed my brother you dont know what youve done he said were in deep trouble he said we he said we wed both be killed if friedman ever found out you were working for us he said we had to stop you and friedman meeting
well i hope you enjoyed yourself
i didnt intend it that way it just happened he heard from laurence that youd been back that wed argued he asked why and it just happened i told him everything i couldnt help it wanted to see him scared i had never seen him scared before you see
to get me killed
my husband didnt need to slap me about mr lombard i volunteered
perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little
you seem to know what youre talking about
we all have to like what we become cowards included we achieve this by complicating things a little but its never that complicated really
should i
dont you believe in simplicity
simplify and damn
where is that
here we go again
what happened adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice
something like that
something like that
something like that
what was the idea husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed
i didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet mr lombard
a fright five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright
maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright
and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman
were turning in circles
are there truly no extenuating circumstances
you splendid bastard
five years of it surely youd have divorced him if he disgusted you
you bastard
rich young beautiful you must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids
why do i feel i neednt answer that
is there anything to understand
good
i dont
think what you like but dont presume to understand
one just doesnt tell me what does one speak about huh
i didnt know my husband and friedman knew each other i just do you think we spoke about it ive known for five years hes known ive known for five years but not once have we spoken about it there are things one just doesnt speak about
why did you send me after friedman to atone for your sins
that my brother my husband and your mr friedman were linked that much i had guessed but that my husband had killed leon no
you dont say
youre wrong about my being there though carlos borrowed my car that day his had broken down leon saw it like you assumed i was there thought hed wait to ask for a lift but carlos turned up with the tape you found leon got his lift and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out he watched it confronted carlos threatened to tell the police about the hotel i dont know how he knew about the hotel perhaps carlos talked too much my husband did not tell me you more or less guessed the rest i didnt know any of this before you left for los angeles
oh no at long last leon had found a mission hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned your husband killed your brother and thanks to you almost got me killed too
leon could still have hung himself
kids are not your thing deborah youd have been ready for me when i turned up with sleeping beauty damn it then too i should have paid more attention not leon you said it struck me at the time but obviously not hard enough you didnt say my god or whatever else wellbred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved not leon who then you sure were right about one thing deborah the job was too formidable for me i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles but there i was focused so hard on friedman id stopped thinking nothing added up leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at a go infiltrating the world of child traffickers duping friedman into selling him a little boy you sure were right the job was too formidable for me but you knew that didnt you
ifif my car is there i could be the one who why dont you accuse me of killing my brother
your brother stumbled upon adoniss little secret didnt he and traded his silence for a kid and some cash and adonis fell for it bought him his kid sent him away and then killed him when he came back for more leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints he came to extort a second kids life your flunkey let him in so his visit couldnt be concealed hence the exhibition story there was no exhibition just as you suspected remember deborah leon does his own prints wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art i should have paid more attention to your words perhaps its the way you say them
not in the strict sense of the word no he was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when i caught up with him later
youyou spoke to him
i doubt friedman ever even met leon deborah friedman dealt with select customers as for my envelope had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles
leon didnt hang himself deborah your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide how did he do it eh strangulation drugs no doubt an autopsy will tell
leon hung himself
leons not found your parents worry talk of hiring help to find him even mention their manhunter friends perhaps and adonis panics takes control brings me in reckoning a small time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward not before leons found anyhow he must have kicked himself when he learned id exceeded his expectations
leon hung himself
adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest didnt he seemed like a good idea an exjunkie obsessed with death the perfect candidate for suicide he just forgot one thing forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november an englishman might have thought of that but a brazilian
leon hung himself
does the name pierre dreyer mean anything to you hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband
my brother hung himself
what do you mean no mrs de moraes
no
tell me did he kill his little victims too
it must be tough being married to adonis to end up sleeping alone every night sleep must be hard coming whats harder the thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if or imagining what he does with his children
how when did you
i take it you learnt to live with yours then take it all the minddulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your wellbeing
huh dont you recall convincing me he had you should learn to live with your mistakes mr lombard there is some merit in it
you knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance didnt you
whatever the reason im sorry i did goodbye mr lombard i believe you know your way out
i guess the news youd sent me after friedman didnt go down too well eh
you do have a vivid imagination mr lombard i only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious i fail to understand your purpose in this still say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out all right
when did you learn about his taste for kids huh on your honeymoon or was it later when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother how did you find out did he confess try to convert you perhaps or was it womans intuition or just the way he fucked you
have you finished
you know hed have had him killed dont you does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind deborah or is it just cold expediency could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married
why i dont know what youre talking about
ive had a long and unpleasant day im tired and im angry but mad not yet i paid leons boy a visit this morning found him alive and well why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note eh
youre mad
how did you break into my office deborah ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips come on deborah acting dumb doesnt suit you who knew id found dirt on your brother huh who knew it was in an envelope taking me for dead whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands
you what mrs de moraes you what
you you are out of order mr lombard i
or is it the other way round the children are needed because you cant satisfy him
whats in the bag underwear to seduce your husband or is it for your own recreation tell me how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms is it because he does it with little children
sorry
black suits you
i if you dont mind i do not think he matters now it things turned out to be as we thought leon was weak theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore now will you please tell me how much we owe you
arent you curious to know about friedman
i well were burying leon tomorrow and look i wish i had more time but its late and with the funeral
youre repeating yourself mrs de moraes
im really sorry you were not called
why dont you ask when i left the mondrian
when did you get back
how are you mrs de moraes
mr lombard
uh wait a moment mrs de moraes
mr lombard mrs de moraes
yeah goodnight mrs de moraes
paul lamont
not yet the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address ill give it hours he just might show up if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont paul lamont all right
yes you woke me up its the middle of the night here have you found mr friedman
are you all right
have you have you found him yet
the mondrian room the number is plus the la code
just a moment go ahead
have you got a pen
mr lombard
you do want me to keep the job dont you mrs de moraes
you drive a hard bargain mr lombard
wwhy are you telling me all this mr lombard
minimizes the risks children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses these can also be used to move women and drugs anything that makes money really
the hotels are useful capital investments the kids liquid assets my guess is they own hotels across the globe and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot
huh really hotels
you watched the tape friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes mrs de moraes theyre in the importexport business they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware houses and ports of call for their merchandise
are we understood
well i found a little more than that let me put it this way last night i thought your brother might be dead tonight im convinced he is that said i have no evidence and i advise you to let the police deal with it
im impressed that information could have cost me
the man who sold the boy to your brother
who is friedman
you could say that and friedman left this morning for los angeles
you lost my money
last night you upset my sleep tonight my social life we have two minutes my dinner guests are waiting
thank you for coming come in and close the door will you
you drive a hard bargain
i still dont buy your story but i figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry besides if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner we could always get the right people onto you i trust you know who i am talking about
couldnt nazi hunters do the job
huh who do you think we are mr lombard
why me mrs de moraes why should such wellconnected people as you hire a small time french detective to look for their missing son mrs de moraes
the family hired you and i have just fired you mr lombard
i was hired by your parents mrs de moraes
laurence
no youre fired get out of my house and take your sick tape with you
perhaps i should come back when youre
get out of my house youre fired mr lombard
excuse me
no the question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here mr lombard
the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything mrs de moraes
how dare you you dont know this tape belongs to my brother do you mr lombard
look mrs de moraes however much of a let down it might be your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks impressionable as he is he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses tried moving on to bigger things came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table have a look at it mrs de moraes i told you i had bad news
oh no youll have to do better than that mr lombard
i cant tell you that yet but hes being well looked after
where is it he the boy you said my brother bought where is he
i will of course do my best to hang onto it
i need the money to smooth my way you understand now have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning
excuse me
your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place mrs de moraes and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise you dont mess around with child procurers right now my guess is hes either on the run held captive or dead i understand your misgivings mrs de moraes but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man which leads me to why im here at such a late hour i need in cash by this morning
what what are you talking about
you seem surprised could it be you dont think that badly of him after all you neednt worry it seems his motives were pure from what i can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse
theres more your brother also purchased a young boy for
you you found that at leons
its a snuff movie prime paedophile material im told it retails at around i see you dont require a definition
disney how inter
i found this at your brothers
anything is possible
can it be that you want your brother found
can it be that easy
now you are confusing me mrs de moraes
ohoh touch mr lombard but tell me what would you know about sisterly love eh no dont you might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear headed at least until youve done what we are paying you for
i dont know he seems to delight in so much sisterly love he might become determined
for your information mr lombard trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that
im afraid i have bad news mr de moraes i have reason to believe your brothers in trouble
i wont comment on the time but youll understand if i dont tell you to sit down now spare me the apology and get to the point will you mr lombard
was it cash mr de moraes the you gave it to him in cash
perhaps it wasnt so brave of him had i been here i just might have given him his money mr lombard one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct as someone in your line of work ought to know
is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan
i have too much money to work mr lombard
what about you mrs de moraes
well leon does not need money for prints mr lombard does his own printing wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art which as he subsequently vanished raises the question what was the money for perish the thought
and that is the last time any
three weeks ago to borrow money i wasnt here but he got to my husband sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made carlos handed over to get rid of him
that depends what youre looking at
appearances can be deceptive mrs de moraes
now you know why youre here mr lombard it might be difficult for someone like you to discern but we are people of a certain standing
can you tell me how you spell
penrhyndeudraeth north wales
a call box thats odd where exactly
theres nothing wrong with the line sir are you sure you have the right number is the number of a call box
let me check it for you sir
yes im trying to reach a friend but i cant get through the number is
directory enquiries can i help you
not in america sir you must be from europe so black coffee and a couple of crescents
the word for those things is croissants
croissants like that
im sorry sir could you try that again
croissants
crow what
a coffee and a couple of croissants
good morning sir how can i help you
huh and they say charitys only rewarded in heaven hallelujah christ
nothing sticks to slime emily this should cover what you lent me
i can the question is can you lie to your ex husband
you cannot walk away from this you cannot
theyd never let me go and youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me
my exhusband my work drove him away made his life a misery he thinks im obsessed punishing myself for what happened to our son but hes a good guy hell listen to you he wont turn you in if i ask him not to i can pretty much guarantee that okay
what about your friendly cop
im emily stewart the hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen yearold boy disappeared the pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat however i go about this thats who i am do you get what im fucking saying mr lombard
its up to you whether they walk or not
damn it you cant fucking walk away from this
look either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk for gods sake what am i supposed to say i got this from a french guy from england who broke in there to have a chat with an austrian child trafficker is that it
then find another way
a seminar in a baby breeding farm bodies in acid you think ill get anywhere with that jesus with luck i might raise a laugh they might even send a patrol car to check the place out whatever itll be too late
im finished here and im tired emily you shouldnt be here now dont make it worse
thatthat wont do thats not the way it goes you saw it you tell it thats the way
call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid can i have the keys to your house
do you know a friendly cop
were both thinking the same thing right
no one saw me but the italian and a dog i blew up their generator they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up
who knows who cares you wanted slime you got slime
italian the mafia
some italian i picked up back there hes in the boot of the mustang
so who whos the man where is he
friedmans dead they killed him
what some kind of organ factory pregnant girls doped up babies theres a lot of people back there theyre holding a seminar traffickings the past breeding the future
what
whos the guy whos the guy nom de dieu had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate id have had to kill him
look you dont tell me about some godforsaken place where stuff so bad even i couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep what happened whos the guy the austrian
i think so and if it comes to it tell the cops anything you think will make them move whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is bye now
have you found your man is that where he is
route past edwards air force base and about half a mile before a place called the red mountain motel theres a dirt track with a closed to the public sign it leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere if you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry okay but not before you hear
oh what yeah okay
get a pen and dont ask any questions
burn the passport and keep the money think of it as a donation to the cause
what am i to do with the packages if
dont fall asleep with your hair wet
yeah goodnight emily
right well ill get your money first thing in the morning okay okay goodnight then
thank you but i think ill go to bed its been a long day
a little too tight eh they were my sons only thirteen and already six feet tall a real lanky boy i theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry
come on mr lombard you tailed your man all the way here from europe you told me you knew where to find him remember or didnt i hear you right
huh i have no hard evidence
did you not enter this country illegally
a criminal
its give and take time mr lombard you need help we need information you didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it did you
did you call me up here to enjoy yourself emily or to let me use your phone because we seem to have a slight problem
how come youre alive child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do what am i really looking at here huh are you really not just a lousy private eye am i really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise
thank you for the guided tour but would you mind telling me what were doing here
like youll find a way to stop your austrian killing you a second time round
im sure ill find a way
no answer you have no passport and your embassys out how do you plan to leave the us mr lombard
hah what about nathalie
a recent acquisition weve had four break ins this year alone files stolen computers wrecked faeces smeared on walls the good guys dismiss us as alarmist dogooders the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us an easy living indeed mr lombard i got through to moreau and jane i left your landlord out of it your flats been broken into jane wants you to call her back
i wouldnt mind thank you
thereve been international treaties since aimed at preventing child slavery but still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation officially its just not called for sit down can i offer you some coffee
i might come back i might not but if i do it wont be for a couple of hours
i know where to look
you know where to look for your austrian right
i thought youd never ask as i was having my coffee and crescents at the mondrian the other morning i spotted your photograph in the los angeles times theres a tough lady i thought just the kind who might help me
there are over million people in this city why me
lombard it will take a few days for the things i need to get here meanwhile id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog
have you never heard of collect calls mr
no a poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer he disappeared on his second shopping expedition
you dont know why hes come to los angeles the man you say he killed who was he a colleague of his
yeah

oh no im all right he was a jerk really another boy you know all i meet is boys when i think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls i mean is it true
well i hope youre not too heartbroken and
oh we split up
its friday night jane what happened to your latest boyfriend
so you havent seen the film then
that are called rommel or something i guess not that many
i dont know how many famous french film directors can there be
should i
la collectionoose its about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her its on tv tonight and as im in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and the review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct and witty the directors supposed to be famous rommel or something french you must know him
la what
have you heard of a french film called la collectionoose
yes but my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company for expenses and all that you know itd cost you about but he said itd be worth it of course youd need a partner to register but thats a formality i mean i could be your partner i mean just as a name right
good
must be your lucky day then ive got your accounts you dont owe much tax for last year
no
fine how was the match did you loose
how are you jane
hello again neighbour i didnt intrude did i
jah
look at it this way he might achieve everything your son never did
plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education
a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy
fine one more thing mrs and mr spitz may i ask what is or was your occupation
my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel deborah will be here if you need anything before our return
ha no mr lombard his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate
why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography mrs spitz
we are aware of your rates mr lombard we will pay you double your rates plus expenses in return need i say it again we expect discretion and undivided attention
my rates
the is on account
when im told he came here
im sure as far as you know when and where was your son last seen
the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about his address is in this envelope with leonards address keys and other things you might need
any friends
no and before you ask no hes not gay he has had girlfriends but nothing serious
i take it your son is not married mrs spitz
then why arent you asking the police to look for your son mrs spitz
he could indeed mr lombard but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it
so he could have decided to go on a trip
leonard does not hold a driving licence as for his passport i do not know where he keeps it
did you look for his passport driving licence
yesterday it all looked normal
i presume you checked your sons apartment
then you should not have sought an explanation
i didnt mean to imply you did mrs spitz
i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography mr lombard by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold so as you see i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account
check with your sons bank banks dont usually give out information about their customers
do what mr lombard
how did you do that mrs spitz
you wouldnt be here if i knew mr lombard what i do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks that enquiries to the police and london hospitals have borne no results and that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now
what do you think has happened to your son mrs spitz
leonard what my daughter is on about mr lombard is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian you might as well know that
i take it your son is called leon
what i can appreciate is insolence mr lombard
look mrs spitz i dont know to whom im indebted for the recommendation but im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references what i do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not i can be of help i hope you can appreciate that mrs spitz
good now as i trust you may have guessed we are looking for someone to work for us someone whose discretion can be relied upon someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment do you think you could be that person mr lombard
okay recommended
you may not and besides it is irrelevant
didnt you say i came recommended thats what i thought may i know by whom
must i speak to you in french
recommended
whatever you come recommended we
well i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning mrs spitz i wouldnt like to think id kept you waiting for nothing
what if it is
i hope its not too significant
lombard this is not a jewish name is it
may i ask if you are jewish mr lombard
may i
spitz we spoke on the telephone my husband my daughter deborah whose house this is my soninlaw carlos the gentleman is a business partner of his
good afternoon mrs
hohotel los angeles he
the hyatt whats that
hyatt friedmans at the hyatt
trying to say something martin
dying without ever reaching the top
what is
i told you the rabble its me huh its sad
you seem very sure about that
youre making a mistake tough guy whoever he is your guys not one of friedmans
is this friedman martin come on scumbag youve reached your sell by date tell me if this is friedman where he is in los angeles and what name hes using
who are you who are you working for huh
is this friedman
could someone have hurt you that bad
huh im sure thered be lots of takers
you know what martin i ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world free and hope you never die
boys like the one you met today are surplus commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into we improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted improve still more selling them where they are is that too hard for you
im overcome by your publicspiritedness
maybe you should think about it those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines
maybe i dont
money talks bullshit walks whether you like it or not
only feeding the disease eh martin
huh id have thought a tough guy like you would know better the sick ones are out there friend they make up the clientle get rid of them and were out of business
is it real you people are sick
maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me come on lets go
youre out of your mind whats the idea
shut up and drive
this car needs petrol
dont jump any red lights
no in hampstead why
friedman lives with you at the ambassador
look i dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here mister whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner eh
where is friedman
huh i doubt it friedman only deals directly with select customers i handle the rabble
this one came back and was never seen again i understand friedman looked after him
clients come and go
six weeks ago he bought a boy of yours
am i supposed to know him
right now your big friend at the diplomat is bleeding fast martin he might still possibly survive if attended to soon and he did cooperate
i dont know what your problem is but
lets go
uhhuh you couldve waited for me inside
is my money in there
problems
does it matter
vous tes franais
anything at all i presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished theres a fee for disposal the boy is yours you understand
anything at all
the rooms yours for hours its sound proofed stocked up with food drink and other things you might find useful you can do anything you like
we conclude our transaction
what happens now
we need a doubleroom and as i understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room
what are you talking about
this is the hotel supervisor mr lamont im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mixup with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve
what is it
le mercury newman street ask for peter
three oclock
at what time will you be available
yeah
its about the puppy you got the money
you must agree to be blindfolded just for the journey it might appear unseemly youre the paying customer but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement
ill be alone
will you be alone the merchandise is it just you or
questions can amount to revelations now id hate to think i was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross examination mr friedman led me to believe we had a deal do we
an austrian not much to go on is it
an austrian
and while visiting our fair city you an austrian
the ladys not a friend shes a whore someone at a special screening i attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an austrian here in london and not just movies
your lady friend did
i dont recollect mentioning a friend
the person who put us in touch seems to think so
have you
i gather weve done business with a friend of yours
should i come back in five minutes
five to three youre early
yes you wouldnt know where i could reach him we had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my paris gallery you see i really need to see him before i leave
im sorry
oh this is wed arranged to meet tonight and im due to return to paris tomorrow
no i meant he left as in no longer works here
left when i just come from his place and there was no one there a neighbour of his
leon no im afraid he left
no thank you could you tell me if leon spitz is here please
evening table for one
good you neednt worry about the austrian anymore hes dead ill be in touch
fine
hows the boy doing
he showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street
no in fact id seen him a couple of months earlier he was quite depressed his work wasnt getting anywhere he said he was going to try something new realism london in the nineties documentary stuff you know
you sure what about before he turned up with the boy
no
did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work
yes three thousand pounds i still
the money leon left for the boy was it cash
he apparently the hostility was all hers leon didnt it hurt him they used to be close their parents were in their forties when they were born you see and mostly away they grew up in a scottish mansion with old nannies and servants he our world was so old and cold we shone for one another leon used to say his sister cut him off after she got married he never understood why but thought it was because she had no children was bitter
did he ever refer to the hostility between them
er yes
ive been away did leon speak to you about his sister
the nineteenth how come you didnt know
whats the date
hed come prepared he had something besides shiva sleeping beauty the disney film well it looked like the disney film it was something else i couldnt watch
no sick people in the country huh just tell me one thing rhian leons story about the boy you just took his word for it
im sorry its just you dont look local
and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun if leons austrian was looking for you i reckon hed have found you before i did
oh i she just moved ive got her new its in my book in the kitchen wait thank you
i cant think of a good reason for it for now anyway my number if anything happens whats your sisters number
yesyouyoure not going to take shiva away
is she on the phone
my sister she lives in the next valley
who else knows about the boy
albert albert and ethel why
do you know leons parents names
theyre german jews came here before the war they both lost all their families in extermination camps but they themselves never went near one the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon its not guilt more of a curse and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions
im afraid i dont understand
yeah but he didnt beat the demons a quarter of all the shoes sold in europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire all started from a small shop in the east end of london and war reparation money for holocaust victims
his mother would be pleased to hear that
thats what he said i tried to dissuade him told him i couldnt take on another child that hed get into trouble i mean people who sell children but he wasnt listening i guess he finally found himself a crusade his family think hes back on drugs eh huh leon did drugs a lot of drugs went through his selfdestruct phase you know things to come to terms with demons to fight some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated not leons he did beat the drug though he did
good reasons
he just said he had good reasons
did leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved rhian
we didnt quite make it as lovers leon is a good man though
shut up
what are you going to do now call the police take him away i must warn you hes terrified of men so
youyoure wrong i just called to ask if i could stay with him next time im in london thats all
havent you then why the worried messages on his answering machine rhian id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble
you thought wrong i havent seen leon for months
well i obviously do and i also know that leons not here rhian but i thought that you might know where i should look for him
leons not here how did you get here phil doesnt know where i live
as you know from speaking to phil your friend leon has disappeared rhian his family have hired me to find him
no what do you want here how do you know me
can i get up now
whats a french private investigator doing here
should i be
a private investigator youre not austrian
reach for it and throw it to me and my fingers on the trigger you hear

huh im a businessman what are you eh
dont tempt me the last scumbag who thought i might kill him died soon afterwards
what you gonna do kill me
shut up and walk
when they realise im missing
thats what he said
youre sure he said his caller was a man
two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the london hotels he didnt need your confession
what sums
some guy called to let him know the frenchman whod called the night before he left london was in la looking to kill him he did his sums and decided to take the call seriously
not even scum like friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call
i can only tell you what he told us
try again and this time be polite
thats the beauty an anonymous call makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to eh frenchfuck
so you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room how did friedman say he got to know where to find me
huh maybe he figured the news our london bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well he only shared his guilty secret last night and then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk
i think youd rather not know what i think
what do you think huh
so why didnt he
if he had youd be dead
are you telling me friedman didnt tell you i was here looking for him
thats just it the sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues testa di cazzo hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you he hasnt gone to hell too soon and neither will you mr lamont
nice way to help a colleague in trouble
huh you turned him into a liability didnt you know
why did you kill him
let me give you a tip asshole no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in london and here tonight and hopes to get away with it it upsets people its wrong fucking wrong
why did you kill friedman
huh youve been around eh
the acid bath
youre the lantern man huh if you wanna see whats left of him
glucks dead you sonofabitch
three
fuck
five seconds then you die
figlio di puttana youre the french asshole who bumped off the london guys
gluck
who i dont know who the fuck youre talking about sunshine
okay shitbag im only going to ask you this once where is friedman
its a good guess
mossad
their last suspected kill occurred two years back though your spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group still id watch my step these people are wellconnected laurent former israeli prime minister etc the ladys also president of an international zionist organisation anyway you get the picture
are they still operative
it appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady german group of nazi hunters known as never forget over the years were talking about a dozen or so executiontype killings
they lost their son why
salut laurent ouais it wasnt easy but i got what you wanted through interpol say whats your business with these spitzes
moreau cest moi alors
tremoille dont please
what do you fear most now my sword or his hands
no i see the hand of tremoille and regnault and yolande and you and they are dirty hands
jean me dear loyal jean why do you want to oppose the will of god jeanne wanted to go to compiegne we let her she got caught then on my personal orders regnault proposed crowns for her ransom and once again the answer was no and now you say she tried to escape and the answer is still no jean open your eyes cant you see the hand of god in all this
but not impossible gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her
jean its its not so easy
we have to do something before she tries it again i beg of you my lord dont let her down let me organize an escape
its a miracle shes not dead
jeannes been badly injured she jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat
my dear aulon thats fine
gold crowns
very generous of you all how much
here to help pay jeannes ransom all the captains gave what they could as well as the citizens of orleans and the other towns she saved
yes my lord
jeanne this is in fact my loyal friend and finest archer jean daulon jean i place her in your care find her suitable lodgings here in the castle and guard her with your life
so pretend its not a game
sire you know how bad i am at this sort of game
good until then feel free to live like a king
of course i am its just that
why are you not ready to die for your king
majesty i cant
my dear aulon to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood
my lord im not sure that
why not you jean daulon the only man whos poorer than i am and so the only man i can trust dignified honorable wise what more could we ask of a king
if she can find me thats a brilliant idea if shes really been sent by god shell discover the trap and if shes an assassin shell kill the wrong man bring her up
let someone else pretend to be you and see if
what do you mean
thats a good idea sire
oh dear why is life so complicated sometimes i really wish i could be someone else
then her faith will have to be bigger
but her armys so small now
dont worry charles if god is still with her she will be victorious were not her judges were just spectators let her go to compiegne as you let her go to orleans and let god decide her fate
i i cant stop her
i assure you charles the maiden has no greater admirer than myself but whatever our personal feelings we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war for the sake of the kingdom it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne
its true theres only one king people need to be reminded of that nevertheless jeanne has done so much for us
for the sake of france charles and for the sake of my grandson
you will
youre a fine judge of character charles itll take you less than five minutes to expose her if shes a fake but if shes not then she will give you your answers and place the crown on your head
you really think shes been sent by god
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions
wwwhat has that got to do with this maiden
mmmm yes i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart i know how painful it is for you to have loved a father without ever knowing if he really was yours
you think
your health and happiness has always been my first concern charles ever since you were a little boy and i think i know you better than your own mother
why do you have to be so bloodthirsty do you enjoy it all that blood and noise and pain diplomacy is far more civilized far safer and far cheaper
peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance
well we are of course enormously grateful for your past efforts but your task is done now its time for negotiation and after many months of skillful work our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english you see my dear jeanne as it is written in the bible to everything there is a season a time for war and a time for peace
so how would you put it
gave you well now i wouldnt quite put it like that
why did you betray me paris was ours for the taking all i needed was another few hundred men why did you take back the army you gave me
now hold on youre not captain here on the battlefield perhaps but not in the royal bedchamber
get them out of here
and my crown doesnt fit and really
you look wonderful
ah jeanne come here this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco nothing is ready
orleans has held out for six months i dont suppose a few days will make much difference take some rest
i dont need lodgings if were to be marching on orleans
he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god and he told me that i jeanne will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france
and what what did he say
i didnt wait long one day i was going to mass like i do every day when the same strange wind started blowing again
you did well
what was my mission to help my country but how could i do that i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it
i know youre not yet but you will be soon
im im not the king
theres no need to be afraid sire
noooo
i i dont know itll sound like we betrayed her
let them come let them see whos the true king of france
theres no time sire we cant hold up the ceremony theres no telling when the english might come back theyre only ten leagues away
hes probably right lets call a delay
no doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause but what about the ordinary soldier they dont fight for causes these days they fight for money whos going to pay them
my captains have sworn their support
to ensure our privacy i need to talk to her alone
as always majesty
my dear loyal tremoille i know i can count on you
your majesty i really think you
tremoille im not even king yet whod want to assassinate me
supposing shes an assassin
my astrologers assure me that the hour is pppropitious leo with virgo rising have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the virgin is next to the lion
your majesty i urge you not to see this woman it all reeks of a burgundian trap
the other half
i can see her if i want to i mean with half of france in the hands of the english what have i got to lose
not exactly she wants you to give her an army at your expanse bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury i fail to see how you can afford such an adventure
if she comes from burgundy it makes a difference it might be a trap look signed x what sort of name is x or must we conclude that a messenger of god cant even write her own name
what difference does it make where she comes from
you mustnt see her my lord we know nothing about her we dont even know if she is from lorraine
she says shell be here tomorrow
she pretends shes been sent by god these charlatans its a pity there isnt enough wood to burn them all
i want to be at one with him now
soon youll be able to take the holy mass and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood you will be at one with him
i want to be with him always
jeanne be patient
i dont want to wait for his call
jeanne calm down calm down jeanne
then what will and what will bring her back and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me why didnt he take my life instead of hers it was my fault i was late she gave me her hiding place
i realize your anger jeanne but we must learn to forgive its hard but revenge will never bring about peace
i know jesus says to love our enemies but i cant i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever
only god knows the answer to that
why did she have to die
i heard about your sister and i understand your pain
perhaps but wherever he comes from i think you should listen to him because it sounds like hes giving you very good advice
he says he says i must be good and help everyone and take care of myself do you think hes coming from the sky
and what does he say to you
beautiful
what does he look like
he never says his name
who is this he
well i try and talk to him but mostly hes the one who does the talking
him
i feel safe here and its where i can talk to him
then why are you here so often
yes it is
so everything sounds wonderful
oh yes i play with them lots
and what about your other friends you dont like playing with them
oh yes my sisters just shes wonderful
good good and your sister catherine shes still your best friend
oh yes shes wonderful
and your mother everythings fine with her
oh yes very
well no but jeanne are you happy at home
is that bad
jeanne if we were to ask forgiveness all the time wed spend our whole life in church
he already did but i want god to forgive me too
im sure hell forgive you
my fathers
whose were they
they werent my shoes mine were too small
theres no sin in charity jeanne
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some
so alright what terrible sin have you committed since then that cant wait till tomorrow to be forgiven
i need to confess again
but you already confessed this morning
i need to confess
you know im always happy to see you jeanne but to keep coming here twice three times a day
well he has nothing to pack but he is leaving and it is just as well nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him we have had some tears
baines is packing up
he is quite altered as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone
that is good yes
how are the lessons going ada nods enthusiastically hes getting on all right ada nods again good
certainly there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent
and with time she will im sure become affectionate
oh indeed cotton
there is something to be said for silence
oh yes yes of course a concern
well she was very violent with the gown she tore off a chunk of lace if hadnt been there id have sworn shed used her teeth
no it was a table
no sound at all
i knew she was mute but now im thinking its more than that im wondering if shes not brain affected
its strange isnt it i mean its not a piano it doesnt make any sound
like it were a piano
what would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano
i miss you
no i love her we will be a family i have her piano i will mend it she will get better

hah youre very cunning ada but ive seen through you im not going to lose the land this way wait here

macaulay
i dont know anything ive been in california for four years what about his lawyer used to be a guy named mac something
disappeared
thats what i was going to ask you hes disappeared
yes some nut who wanted to kill him how is your father
andy this is nick charles he worked on a case for father
probably not
was fascinated with you a real live detective you used to tell me the most wonderful stories were they true
how did you ever remember me
yes
not that scrawny little
you dont remember me im dorothy wynant
yes
arent you nick charles
of course we do weve been friends for years
you know we know each other
hello there
another martini
yes yes
must have been in the war that might account for the cane and his limp
shrapnel
im very interested in that body
not at all
do you mind if i come down and see it
yes
going to run him through the fluoroscope
you can take that out to the car
you see hed been very clever everybody even our astute friend guild thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer but our hero had just one weak link in his chain the telegrams wires and telephones were all very well but no one had seen wynant so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is mimi who was it that told you to say youd seen wynant
shut up
was wynants
you mean that body
because i found out for certain that he didnt commit the murders
why didnt you tell me why didnt you hold him
no
are you kidding
ill take care of him
whatre you doing here
just the same wynant wouldnt mind having him out of the way would he how long should you say this bodyd been here doc
yes but we figured it was just blackmail
he said wynant tried to steal an invention
i never saw him i dont think anyone saw him
could this be him
rosebreen
dwr that case you worked on the guy who threatened to kill wynant what what was his name
extraordinarily lucky
lucky thing for us they werent in that lime
just rolled them up and threw them in
this is enough for me
fifty will still get you a hundred
i guess that cinches it eh mr charles he killed them both julia wolf and nunheim
shes ready to talk it wont do any harm though to find out where he is
get anything
nunheim
trail him trail who
im calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him i want to see where he goes
whore you calling
i think were on the right track
well whatd you think
lets go and see taxi
hes holding out on you
no
did you know he was hanging around julia
oh hes all right we know all about him he does a little stooling for us every once in a while
what about this nunheim
ill check on that im afraid this is kinder dull for you
what about jorgensen
theyre all ok mrs jorgensen the boy dorothy macaulay even morelli we had to let him go
i havent got that far yet but i dont think that everything points to wynant what about the alibis
whos your candidate
for one thing he was too absent minded to hold a grudge
what do you mean
fifty will get you a hundred that he didnt do it
nothing yet to cinch it
no proof
yeah couldnt find a thing this is the way we figure it wynant goes to julias apartment he finds morelli there sees shes two timing him they have a fight but he figures he dont want to do anything then morelli might squeal so he goes away he dont let his lawyer know anything has happened he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him so that julia will think its all blown over then when she dont expect it he lets her have it
youve been there
i thought it might be from now on theyre going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is wynant
oh thats a phoney the men didnt even have to go down
what about the suicide
its a bargain then anything you want to know
so would i
man to man im not
man to man mr charles are you working on this case
that aint a gun any more the firing pins busted the dont waste time talking about that
you mean about that gun
you oughtnt to play this trick on me running out when i was giving you time to rest up before i asked you those questions
okay theres plenty of time i guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on well come up tomorrow when youre feeling better come on
ill have to try to remember
whos is it
no
this gun yours
ever heard of the sullivan act
no
have you got a pistol permit
so you say go on bob
not without a warrant
keep on asking
im asking you
ask him i dont know
whatd he think it was to you
nothing
whats that to you
wanted to tell me he didnt kill julia wolf
whats he want of you
i never saw him before
we were looking for this bird
yes i might not have been shot
we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family so we figure well stick around in case the old man himself shows up then we seen him sneak in and we decide to come up and pretty lucky for you
howd you people happen to pop in
well thanks well call you when we need you again
i didnt know they had a fight
do you know what they fought about that night he went away
i know hell turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers you cant think he had anything to do with it mr guild he wasnt the kind of man that
yes but he didnt show up
did you go
about three
when was that
i wasnt in my secretary took the message he left word for me to meet him at the plaza
he did
he telephoned me today
well what
well
oh then you did hear from him
i said he hadnt written me
seen any signs of it bill
yesterday i gave her a thousand dollars
when was the last time you gave her money for wynant
let him have his say out
thats ridiculous
tell em
a brown suit brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red or reddish brown figures on it
what kind of clothes was he wearing
thats nothing i saw him myself
you did
goodbye
goodbye
thats all right well well be going
the medical examiner seems to think that the body was touched he says it looks as if the girls hand had been forced open after she was killed
i dont think so of course i was terribly upset i hardly knew what i was doing
are you sure you didnt leave the room that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone
no
did you see anything in miss wolfes hand
why yes
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it til we came
i see
there are a few things we want to check up on
youre a great help to a hostess i wish i always had you for my dinner parties
theyll be here dont worry my men are picking them up
mr guild means guests oh there are two more to come
i guess all the suspects are here
i think we may as well sit down
looks like he planned something he shut up his apartment and his shop
do you think that wynant did it
i dont mind telling you id rather have you working with us than against us
but hes interested
good morning lieutenant sorry
good morning
just give me a minute ill remember im not stalling lieutenant you know i always come clean with you gee itd serve me right if you had pinched me thats the afternoon i was wait ill show you
howd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering
i cant remember offhand lieutenant maybe i was over at charlies shooting pool maybe i was here shed remember
sit down we didnt come here to watch you and that broad dance around a may pole where were you the afternoon the girl was killed
let me go let me bring her back i cant get along without her ill bring her right back and ill tell you anything you want to know let me go
marian marian dont go ill behave ill do anything dont go marian
where were you
where were you
you dont think i had anything to do with it
youd done better to have told me that in the beginning where were you the afternoon she was knocked off
i didnt mean you mister
want to take a poke at him
thats a lie lieutenant anybody that says that is a liar
maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldnt have so much trouble with this one
she drives me nuts shes been ragging me all day
thats all i did lieutenant thats the gods truth maybe i said hello to her or how are you or something like that when i saw her but thats all i knew her thats the truth all right put your mouth in and ill pop a tooth out of it
whats the idea of telling me you just knew the wolfe girl by sight
have a shot
what about it tanner isnt that the truth
i have no right to answer that
oh he as clever about that he called when you were out that same afternoon julia telephoned to him she said that you were coming mimi to ask about wynant he got terrified he was afraid that julia would break down and tell so he went to julia and killed her and left wynants watch chain in her hand
but it must have been wynant i should have known if it werent his voice
hello where in allentown yes when is the next train right ill get that wynants tried to commit suicide they want me to come down and identify him i guess this changes the whole story doesnt it that looks like an admission of guilt and i had such hopes i thought if you got on the case youd be able to clear him i thought that mimi the way she acted i was sure that oh well well its no use thinking of it now im sorry to have wasted so much of your time
hello oh just a minute police department
ive done that already he should appear you know it doesnt look well his staying away at a time like this
it wouldnt hurt to put it in
he gave me a code message to insert in the times in case i wanted to get in touch with him
it might
slim
what are the chances of getting you to do what he wants
thats all right
i hate to bother you when youre laid up
how are you
slong
how do you do what did you say he is where is he very well hes back in town wynant thank heaven hes waiting for me now forgive me mrs charles but ive been so upset its no joke working for a man like that i must be off goodbye goodbye
my wife
he sends word through julia wolf when he wants money i give it to her and she gives it to him
no word at all
you know as much about it as i do i havent seen him in three months
whats all the fuss about is he in hiding
i see i see
my wifes father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things and im looking after them
you dont say
i havent been a detective for four years
she usually is trying one way or another to get money out of wynant i wanted to find out if you were er er sleuthing for her
mimi oh dorothys mother does she have to be up to something
nothing thank you nothing i wanted to see you whats mimi up to charles
thats all right what are you drinking
dorothy told me you were here i was going to telephone but
hello macaulay come in
how are you
macaulay you drew up wynants will mimi was cut off wasnt she if she remarried
im lot going to stay here to be insulted
youre lying mimi but then youd do anything for money youre getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you wont get anything if hes dead
it isnt a story its true i did see wynant hes not dead
what did he pay you mimi to stick to that story
nobody told me i did see him
and the murderer is right here in this room tonight hes sitting at this table you may serve the fish
perfectly absurd
so i did i saw him lying buried in his shop
because i dont believe that clydes dead why you said yourself you saw him last night
he didnt say very much wanted to know how i was and how the children were
oh did he what did he say
last night he came to see me at my apartment
you did where
ive got some very important news ive seen wynant
this is all very pleasant but why are here
all right then ill tell them who did do it
theyll want more than your word for that
i tell you he didnt do it
thats not for you to decide everybodys under suspicion especially running off like this the police will want his description is this a picture of him
but he has nothing to do with it
you should have told them hed disappeared
chris may be at the club or somewhere i dont see that its important
gilbert is he here too we might as well be living in the lobby
wheres gilbert
yes
dorothy is she here
i tell you again i dont want any part of it now you take dorothy home and
but he knows you all you have to do is get in touch with him and tell him that mimi says everything is all right but that ive got to see him
now mimi there are a thousand detectives in new york hire one of them
nick you will help me find clyde wont you
youre always teasing
well dont you
oh i know he didnt but i wish i could find him i have something very important to tell him macaulay wont help at all he thinks i just want money
what do you think
clyde wynants crazy absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this no wonder the police think he has something to do with it
want to talk to you about something very important
hello mimi
oh nick nick
i hope you wont let this news spoil your dinner nice food isnt it
what am i the fall guy
thank you now ill tell you why i know wynant didnt commit those murders three months ago the night that he caught you in julias apartment he found out that julia was cheating him and was splitting with some man he went to find the man that man was tanner dont you
once i wanted five grand cash
why do you say that
she dont say she is but i figure she is
morelli you knew julia was she gypping wynant
this is your party
whats that
i am on the level if i knew anything id
thatd be very smart thatd be the smartest thing i ever did me that a police captains been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument the boys would like to have me come in and ask questions theyd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks now i come to you on the level studsy says youre on the level be on the level
id tell you if i knew but im not in this ask the police
hes all right hed like to see you but listen whats the law doing to me do they think i did it or is it just something else to pin on me
how is studsy i didnt know he was out of stir
listen studsy burke told me you used to be ok thats why im here do they
thats all swell only youre peddling your fish in the wrong market ive got nothing to do with it
i wouldnt have any reason to hurt her she was always on the up and up with me but that dirty little nunheim he got sore cause i clicked with her and he didnt so he put the finger on me
why tell me
i havent seen her in three months we were all washed up
all right you didnt
i didnt knock julia off
ive never heard about you
do you mind putting that gun away my wife doesnt care but im in a delicate condition
i gotta talk to you i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight get me
his plan was still working beautifully wynant was established as being in town the watch chain was handed over with a slight delayto the police the only hitch was a man named nunheim who had found out something our hero paid nunheim once to keep his mouth shut and when nunheim threatened him again he bumped him off
i hope youre well
its the only way it makes sense
why are you saying it
i dont know
is that true
after our hero had killed wynant he got a brilliant idea he realized that he and julia could still collect money wynant was supposed to be on a trip no one knew where so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay signing wynants name so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia he even telephoned macaulay do you remember the first day that you came to see me he telephoned that he was in town
if that knife is missing ill look for it in your back
lets see where was i oh yes he went to find the man that man was desperate he knew that he was caught dead to rights and with prison staring him in the face he took the only way out he killed wynant its terrible to tell you this way but your fathers dead dorothy
youre going to drive me crazy
im afraid youre lying mimi you see i really did see wynant last night
serve the nuts i mean serve the guests the nuts
i wish youd tell me
i wish youd tell me who

but the poor kids going crazy shed rather know her father was dead than that
hey hey dont do that
im going to tell her
no nobody but you
wynant dead does dorothy know
smart gal
then he couldnt have committed those other murders
couple of months anyway
how long has he been dead
i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin it often bothered him so i looked for it and i found it gimme
you dont get another swallow til you really open up
sure
well dont they
oh well the clothes for instance they were carefully preserved and the body was just as carefully destroyed the person who killed him counted on one thing that all skeletons look alike
what things made you so sure
huh
nick youll drive me crazy what things
several things hello fred were hungry again yeah and lots of onions oh and coffee
what makes you so sure its wynants body
thats what they think guild and all of them they take it for granted that its just another of wynants victims guilds hotfooting it around now looking for wynant thats all that troubles him
but they all said it was rosebreens

please madame colet i believe in doing things correctly shall we continue two hairpins one cigarette lighter one box of real matches and oh yes this letter from major
but really msieu this isnt necessary
one purse empty one vanity case
the pleasure is mine madame
wellhow do you do msieu laval
and i am msieu lavalif you will allow me to introduce myself
welli am madame colet
not in the least madame but you see its a very expensive bagone has to be careful
of course it is are you doubting me
oh thats strange maybeare you sure this is your bag
i dont know how i could have lost it there i was nowhere near that niche
neither do i thats where i found it
not particularly
you like that statue
i remember
and in that niche there is a statue of venus
i know that niche
and as you leave the foyer there is a little niche
yes
then you go into the foyer
yes
then you go to the left theres a landing
yes
you know the main staircase in the opera
thats it yes thats it jacques
will you be good enough to look at this bag madame
yes
jacques
you know what paris is saying about the countess falconier and her chauffeur
he is my secretary i hope that answers all your questions msieu giron
madame let me ask you who is msieu laval anyhow where does he come from what is he
i know
madame colet ive enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years i was a school friend of your husbands
to msieu laval
im sorry madame but there are still certain matters which i think you should attend to yourself and i personally would not care to refer them toto
but my dear msieu giron im having a tea party must i be bothered with all these papers now
i put the diamond in my coat pocket and i put my coat on her
what could possible be funny
there are still some boats forward stay with this one murdoch he seems to be quite practical
were too late
so do i
i make my own luck
then thats our play but were still going to need some insurance come on
the one on the other side is letting men in
were running out of time and this strutting martinet isnt letting any men in at all
shes not on the starboard side either
this is ridiculous lovejoy find her
none of the stewards have seen her
theres no need for language mr hockley go back and turn the heater on in my room so it wont be too cold when we get back
its just the god damned english doing everything by the book
she knows
you know i dont like that rose
all part of my charm ruth at any rate it was my darling fiancees beauty rituals which made us late
honestly cal if you werent forever booking everything at the last instant we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family
steerage swine apparently missed his annual bath
it is unsinkable god himself couldnt sink this ship
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable
your daughter is much too hard to impress ruth mind your step
jewels are precious goodbye mr hockley
youre precious to me rose
tell her that her daughter died with the titanic
what do i tell your mother
is this in any way unclear
rose your mother and i have been looking for you
yes i lived how awkward for you
id rather be his whore than your wife
where are you going to him is that it to be a whore to that gutter rat
not the better half
oh mother shut up dont you understand the water is freezing and there arent enough boats not enough by half half the people on this ship are going to die
maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on
but i was with him the whole time
thats right two things dear to me have disappeared this evening now that one is back i have a pretty good idea where to find the other search him
something serious has happened
im not some foreman in your mills than you can command i am your fiancee
you will never behave like that again do you understand
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me
yes your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting
i was tired
i had hoped you would come to me last night
the heart of the ocean cal its its overwhelming
it was once worn by louis the sixteenth they call it le coeur de la mer the
diamond yes it is carats
my god cal is it a
rose is displeased mmm what to do
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love
you wanted to see the propellers
i was leaning way over to see the ah propellers and i slipped and i would have gone overboard and mr dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself
it was stupid really i was leaning over and i slipped
an accident
cal stop it was an accident
what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee look at me you filth what did you think you were doing
hell never amount to a thing trust me at least they were cheap
youre wrong theyre fascinating like in a dream theres truth without logic whats his name again picasso
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money
i felt like black
i couldnt let you wear black on sailing day sweetpea its bad luck
you told me to change
i always win jack one way or another pity i didnt keep that drawing its going to be worth a lot more by morning
almost as good as you
youre a good liar
get in hurry up its almost full
ill be alright hurry up so we can get going we got our own boat to catch
there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in jack and i can get off safely both of us

no caviar for me thanks never did like it much
just a soupcon of lemon it improves the flavor with champagne

a diamond a very rare diamond called the heart of the ocean
what is it a sapphire
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out
should i be expecting him anytime soon
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere

sssshh come here
fabrizio said you might be up
i have to get back theyll miss me please jack for both our sakes leave me alone
youre right only you can do that
its not up to you to save me jack
i dont think so theyve got you in a glass jar like some butterfly and youre goin to die if you dont break out maybe not right away cause youre strong but sooner or later the fire in you is goin to go out
youre making this very hard ill be fine really

time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin
jack must you go
cal surely you remember mr dawson
i saw that in a nickelodeon once and i always wanted to do it
they didnt teach you that in finishing school here its easy watch closely
i think i would and teach me to spit too like a man why should only men be able to spit its unfair
sure if you like
you mean one leg on each side scandalous can you show me
alright were going well drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and well ride horses on the beach right in the surf but you have to ride like a cowboy none of that sidesaddle stuff
why cant i be like you jack just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it say well go there sometime to that pier even if we only ever just talk about it
yeah it was great money i could make a dollar a day sometimes but only in summer when it got cold i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing
a whole ten cents
well then logging got to be too much like work so i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica thats a swell place they even have a rollercoaster i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece
so then what mr wandering jack
well alright theres something in me jack i feel it i dont know what it is whether i should be an artist or i dont know a dancer like isadora duncan a wild pagan spirit
im sorry really i am
listen buster i hate caviar and im tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head
you wouldnt last two days theres no hot water and hardly ever any caviar
you know my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist living in a garret poor but free
you wouldnta jumped
and
i see you
you have a gift jack you do you see people
no no just with her hands
i think you must have had a love affair with her
she had beautiful hands
you liked this woman you used her several times
yup thats one of the great things about paris lots of girls willing take their clothes off
and these were drawn from life
well they didnt think too much of em in paree
oh no oh im so sorry truly
well they didnt think too much of em in paree
jack these are quite good really they are
may i
just some sketches
whats this
well i guess i will tonight

oh god i am such an utter fool
uh huh theyll be sorry course youll be dead
i dont it wasnt just one thing it was everything it was them it was their whole world and i was trapped in it like an insect in amber i just had to get away just run and run and run and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship even the titanic wasnt big enough not enough to get away from them and before id really though about it i was over the rail i was so furious ill show them theyll be sorry
thats not what i was thinking what i was thinking was what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out
look i know what you must be thinking poor little rich girl what does she know about misery

you leave the kid alone
thanks to me

it wasnt smart even if youd gotten away without me id have found youno matter where you were
i didnt want to see you againthats my privilege
you ran away because you were afraid i dont want it to end like that
all rightbut what is there to face its finished
this is interesting why didnt you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night
i tried to borrow a gun from chad but
because i was yellow i guess
why
i wouldnt say that im glad hes deadyesid thought of killing him but i didnt
spose youve never thought of killing him

you didnt have a gun in your hand last night
yes yes
hes a swell person he told me hed rather turn one guy straight than jug a million
next time i get a vacation ill spend it at headquarters goodnight

ive got a hunch youre going to win that bet inspector
soon as i get that bracelet back im going to relax wish the guy that borrowed it would help me outi got to win that fifty bucks
for a very excellent reason from your own admission im not saying you udidubut i think you know more than youre telling years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence nevertheless in your case theres plenty of it
why should uiu kill him
i sincerely hope so
thats the truthevery single word
maybe you will after youve thought it over
sure i wouldbut i dont get what youre driving at
and if you liked the person youd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight wouldnt you
well of course i wouldnt take it
i mean if you knew it were stolen

i calculate thats the end of this town and lets dont bother about the luggage darling
bless you darling darling are you mad youre not wearing a bustle how lewd
here doc
run take that girl and start running run and dont look back all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by this time run and dont look back and call it living live every second live it right up to the hilt live wyatt live for me
all right then what
first you can grab that black haired woman and make her your own
then what do i do
i played the cards i was dealt wyatt your problem is youre always trying to play someone elses allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free there is no happiness wyatt there is no normal life theres only life thats all just life the rest is relative

you think im kidding youre the most fallible wrongheaded self deluding just generally benighted jackass ive ever known yet withal even at your worst youre the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope
all right doc
i imagine it would yes so now we can add selfpity to your list of frailties
hurts hurts pretty bad
rather an obvious question under the circumstances dont you agree a better one might be how do you feel
how you feelin doc
well hell wyatt wyatt i want you to meet father feeney father feeneys just been initiating me into the mysteries of the great and ancient church of rome you see it appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds
never got to wear one of those

what does he want he wants revenge
so what does he want
a man like ringos got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he cant ever fill it he cant kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it and it drives him mad sick mad cold and dirty
what makes a man like ringo doc what makes him do the things he does
dont touch me god damn it just dont touch me come on

oh mr donowitz
i dont think thatll be necessary lets all have a seat boris why dont you be nice and get coffee for everybody
well i have to admit walkin through the door and seein these soldier of fortune poster boys made me a bit nervous but lee im fairly confident that you came here to do business not to be a wiseguy so if you want ill put the gun on the table
i wanna be able to announce this deal at cannes if i had time for a courtship lee i would id take ya out id hold your hand id kiss you on the cheek at the door but im not in that position i need to know if were in bed together or not if you want my movie lee youre just gonna have to come to terms with your fear and desire
well then whats the hurry is it true the rights to doctor zhivago are in arbitration
now thats bullshit lee every time you buy one of those little movies its a risk im not sellin you something thats gonna play two weeks six weeks then go straight to cable this is doctor zhivago thisll be packin em in for a year and a half two years thats two years you dont have to work with anybodys movie but mine
but the bottom line is im not paramount i have a select group of distributers i deal with i buy their little movies accomplish what i wanna accomplish end of story easy businesslike very little risk
the biggest the biggest movie youve ever dealt with lee were talkin a lot of film a mand have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that and lee youre no idiot
i dont know clarence doctor zhivago is a pretty big movie

its a fact sicilians have nigger blood pumpin through their hearts if you dont believe me look it up you see hundreds and hundreds of years ago the moors conquered sicily and moors are niggers way back then sicilians were like the wops in northern italy blond hair blue eyes but once the moors moved in there they changed the whole country they did so much fuckin with the sicilian women they changed the bloodline for ever from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin i find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day hundreds of years later sicilians still carry that nigger gene im just quotin history its a fact its written your ancestors were niggers your great great great great greatgrandmother was fucked by a nigger and had a halfnigger kid that is a fact now tell me am i lyin
come again
you know i read a lot especially things that have to do with history i find that shit fascinating in fact i dont know if you know this or not sicilians were spawned by niggers
uhhuh

look id help ya if i could but i havent seen clarence
i have a son of my own about you boys age i can imagine how painful this must be for you but clarence and that bitchwhore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves and i implore you not to go down the road with em you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice

ive heard of blue lou boyle
im the antichrist you get me in a vendetta kind of mood you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you my name is vincenzo coccotti i work as a counsel for mr blue lou boyle the man your son stole from i hear you were once a cop so i assume youve heard od us before am i correct

are you still working security for foster langley
well ted to tell you the truth i found out through the grapevine that it might be and i only said might be the drexl spivey that was responsible for that restaurant breakin on riverdale
what about him
its about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago drexl spivey
well dont just sit there shoot him
i dont know he just appeared as magic
whered he come from
absolutely
could we try it now
sure no problem
if we decided on making him a new york type could you do that
thank you
that was very good
well dont just sit there shoot him
i dont know he just appeared as magic
whered you come from
well the part youre reading for is one of the bad guys theres brian and marty peter brecks already been cast as brian and youre reading for the part of marty now in this scene youre both in a car and bill shatners hanging on the hood and what youre trying to do is get him off whenever youre ready
step inside
im me i mean thats me
look we dont care if you bring in the state milita the volunteer fire department the la thunderbirds the ghost of steve mcqueen and the twelve roman gladiators so long as we get credit for the bust
dirty cops well have to bring in internal affairs on this
we talked him into it
hell wear a wire
i believe he believes him
do you believe him
sure was
that was a good fuckin movie
uhhuh
that vietnam movie
okeedokee its like this krinkle a patrol car stops this dork for speeding they walk up to window and the guys covered in coke so they bring his ass in and me an nicholson go to work on him
both you idiots shut up i cant understand shit now whats happened whats going on and what are you talking about
youre an actor so act motherfucker
dont blow it elliot hes bluffin he just told you so himself
this guys gonna kill him
hes bluffin ya elliot cant you see that youre an actor remember the show must go on
whatta we gonna do hes in an elevator
we gotta get him outta there
he knows somethings up
hows he supposed to see the wire
he saw the wire
how the fuck could he know
he knows
hope youre a good actor elliot
you do
you do more than try
so you gotta get him to admit on tape that hes buying this coke
we have to show in court that without a doubt a successful man an important figure in the hollywood community is also dealing cocaine
like gangbusters now remember if you dont want to go to jail we gotta put your boss in jail
this rabbitll do anything not to do time including wearing a wire
hes so spooked hed turn over his momma his daddy his twopanny granny and anna and the king of siam if he had anything on him
he produced coming home in a body bag
to front for him so elliot is workin out the deal between them and his boss a big movie producer named lee donowitz
suspects words
so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin and krinkle you aint gonna fuckin believe it
which wasnt too hard the guy was a real squid
nicholson and i go to work on him now er know somthings rotten in denmark cause this dickhead had a big bag and its uncut too so were sweatin him trying to find out where he got it scarin the shit outta him
nicholson and i
krinkle youre lookin at the two future cops of the month we have it and if i say we i dont mean me and him im referring to the whole department havent had a decent bust this whole month well we mighta come in like a lamb but were goin out like a lion
krinkle this is it we got it man and its all ours i mean talk about fallin into somethin you shoulda seen it it was beautiful dimes is hittin him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers im hittin him form the right about not likin pussy anymore finally he starts cryin and then it was all over
that is of course if you dont catch aids from all your anal intrusions
course youll wanna fuck her in the ass pussy just wont feed right anymore
and just think when you get out in a few years youll meet some girl get married and youll be so understanding to your wifes needs because youll know what its like to be a woman
but there is a bright side though if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throatslitting niggers youll have so much experience to draw on
youre a fuckin star and youre gonna be playin your little oneman show nightly for the next two fuckin years for a captive audience
or a supporting actor
or a bit player
youre no longer an extra
you got caught its all fun and fuckin games till you get caught but now we gotcha ok mr elliot actor youve just made the big time
no dont sit here and feed us some shit
but a fuckin baggie
not a tiny little vial
look sunshine we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine

no theres nothing you have to say to me im getting out scottie for good i cant stay here im winding up her affairs and mine im going to get as far away as i can probably europe and ill probably never come back goodbye scottie if theres anything i can do for you before i go
i i
he had no right to say that it was my responsibility you didnt know her i shouldnt have got you involved
natural fear her grandmother went insane and took her own life and the blood is in madeleine scottie i ask you to watch her closely
why did she never tell her daughter
her mother told me most of then before she died i dug out the rest for myself here
how do you know all these things she doesnt know
she is not my wife
and when she goes to those places
nothing
knows nothing of a grave out at mission dolores or an old house an eddy street or a portrait at the palace of the legion of honor
but she doesnt know about her background she never heard of carlotta valdes
well that explains it anyone could develop an obsession for the past with a background like that
greatgrandmother the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death was madeleines grandmother
carlotta valdes was what your wifes grandmother
something else my wife madeleine has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to carlotta she inherited them never wore them they were too oldfashioned until now now when she is alone she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently curiously puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror and goes into that other world is someone else again
oh yes you noticed the way she does her hair
but you knew about this
i didnt know where she was going to lead you
there are things you didnt tell me
yes
thats carlotta valdes
youve done well scottie youre good at your job
all right you wont know what to look for at first scottie even i who know her so well cannot tell sometimes when the change has begun she looks so lovely and normal
ernies
were going to an opening at the opera tonight well dine at ernies first which is easier
how can i see her to know her
scottie i need a friend someone i can trust im in a panic about this
its not my line
i want you
i can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you theyre dependable good boys
yes but carefully id want to know more before committing her to that kind of care scottie
have you talked to the doctors at all
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven miles that day where did she go i have to know scottie where she goes and what she does before i got involved with doctors
well
watched her come out of the apartment someone i didnt know walking in a different way holding her head in a way i didnt know and get into her car and drive out to golden gate park five miles she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore the portals of the past sat there a long time not moving and i had to leave to got to the office that evening when i came home i asked what shed done all day she said shed driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake thats all
whered she go
more and more in the past few weeks and she wanders god knows where she wanders i followed her one day
how often does this happen
im not making it up i wouldnt know how shell be talking to me about something nothing at all and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank and she is somewhere else away from me someone i dont know i call to her and she doesnt hear and then with a long sigh she is back and looks at me brightly and doesnt know shes been away cant tell me where or why
no
no it sounds idiotic i know and youre still the hardheaded scot arent you always were do you think im making it up
i didnt mean to be that rough
then youre of no use to me im sorry i wasted your time thank you for coming in scottie
id say youd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist psychologist neurologist psychoanalyst or plain family doctor and have him check you both
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife what would you say
no
scottie do you believe that someone out of the past someone dead can enter and take possession of a living being
someone dead
from whom
im afraid some harm may come to her
then
not what you think were very happily married
no no thanks a bit early in the day for spirits well i guess that about covers everything doesnt it i never married i dont see much of the old college gang im a retired detective and youre in the shipbuilding business whats on your mind gavin
would you like a drink now
no acrophobia isnt a crippling thing it just means i cant climb steep stairs or go to high places like the bar at the topofthemark but there are plenty of streetlevel bars in this town
i was sorry to read about that thing in the papers and youve quit the force a permanent physical disability

and an old wooden hotel of the old california days and a saloon dark lowceilinged with hanging oil lamps
at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner
go on
there was a village square a green with trees and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister across the green a big grey wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above a small garden and next to it a livery stable with old carriages lined up inside

no i was being unrealistic even thinking about living this life
i was being foolish
i know
there was a time when i would have welcomed it
there was
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed

im sorry im sure it is
now hold on theres a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job
whacking is not of much use on a farm
i can whack people im hell at whacking
what else can you do
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school
you know carpentry
a real fireball
we had some lemonade and he left
oh what happened to hochstetler
eli is a fine carpenter best in the district he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago
oh the bullets
the bullets
you can go with eli hes taking samuel to school but youll have to hurry
i know what he said
but stoltzfus said

quaint cant imagine why
you make fun of me like the tourists driving by all the time some even come into the yard very rude they seem to think we are quaint
anything against zippers
vain proud such a person is hochmutsnarr he is not plain
hochmut
buttons are hochmut
something wrong with buttons
i should tell you these do not have buttons see hooks and eyes
yes its good that someone can have the use of them besides in your clothes youd stand out to strangers
your husbands
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood i have them soakingyou can wear these
very interesting im learning a lot about manure whats that
enjoying your reading
its not the gun dont you understand its you what you stand for that is not for samuel
nobody meant any harm the boy was curious i unloaded the gun
john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible
you tell him when youre able
tell him his tea stinks
but you cant
listen thank you thanks for everything but ive got to go
two days
how long have i been here
what
how long
only the elders
does anybody know im here
can i have something to drink
the leadership of our district the diener bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top they decided to come and see you for themselves except stoltzfus of course he came the first day i think he saved your life
who are they
but
gunshot theyll file reports theyll find me
but why
no no doctor
but john why didnt you go to a hospital
what about samuel will you come back to take him to trial
i cant
stay for awhile rest ill make coffee and breakfast
i was wrong
you said we would be safe in philadelphia
you couldnt wait until morning
home
where are you taking us now
youll be safe you dont have to worry
im afraid im afraid for samuel i want to go home
because somehow they knew i was getting close look its narcotics they make dope out of chemicals they sell it on the street for millions of dollars theyll do anything and they can get away with it because theyre cops
but why would they murder
listen im the cop that polices the police im not in the business of protecting crooked cops ill make an arrest when i know everybody involved
why dont you arrest that man are you protecting him because policeman
oh yes she thinks you like policing because you think youre right about everything and youre the only one who can do anything and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a um bag of elbows
oh anything else
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own instead of trying to be a father to hers except she thinks youre afraid of the responsibility
no
your sister said you dont have a family
whats a good tired tired is tired
but not a good tired
i would not be too sure
they kid a lot
no youre not youre glad because now youve got a witness i heard the other police talking last night they dont seem to like you very much
look im genuinely sorry
people who dont go into our courts when theyre told to sometimes go directly into our jail
we do not go into your courts
believe me im trying to get this over with as fast as i can but samuel will probably have to come back and testify
yes and i also want to leave this city
whacking
the problem is i dont happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people
now whats the problem
he wants to know who you are your name i told him we dont need to know anything about you
what was that
its not a joke
doesnt surprise me i meet a lot of people like that
you dont understand we have nothing to do with your laws
yes i do your son is a material witness to a homicide
you have no right to keep us here
were looking for a suspect weve reason to believe hes still in the area
where are you taking us
therell be another train the man who was killed tonight was a policeman sam its my job to find out who did it i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there
samuel samuel lapp but what happened here is none of his affair my sister is expecting me our train is leaving soon
